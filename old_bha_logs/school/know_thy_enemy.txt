<hatter> ok
<hatter> Can do
<hatter> Shall I go ahead?
<kratos> i can help too, if i'm here
<hatter> Are we on schedule for right now?
<Fox> Not yet
<kratos> just about to go to the shops lol
<hatter> Shit 
<hatter> I'll go ahead
<Fox> 6:13 pm
<hatter> And then like
<Fox> lol
<hatter> yeah
<Fox> Or fuck it
<hatter> But its 8:28 pm
<hatter> Here
<Fox> lets roll
<hatter> So like
<hatter> idk
<hatter> kkk

<hatter> Your enemy are those who would follow, prosecute, persecute, or attack you.
<hatter> These enemies have different forms of weapons
* skullby (~skullby@lulzsecurity.com) has joined #school4lulz
<hatter> Sniffers, Tempest, TEMPEST II
* GenericSkiddie (~root@behind.7.proxies.net) has joined #school4lulz
* vicki (~io@lulzsecurity.com) has joined #school4lulz
<Fox> TEMPEST.
* sigma (~sigma@LulzCo-E54A5768.hsd1.mn.comcast.net) has joined #school4lulz
<hatter> Sniffers are simply applications which record network information.

<hatter> TEMPEST I allows the government or MISUSE OF GOVT RESOURCES (this does occur) TO READ SHIT OFF OF YOUR SCREEN
<hatter> they can read it by reading the signals of radio waves (radiation) etc off of your monitor output
<hatter> hence you've heard the term "Faraday cage"
* Fox gives voice to vicki
<hatter> Tempest II, something a great deal more dangerous,
* snw (ee@LulzCo-236B1969.getinternet.no) has joined #school4lulz

* mks2 (~mks@LulzCo-9C7131C0.dhcp.embarqhsd.net) has joined #school4lulz
<hatter> vicki: long time no talk, you know me under another handle, pm afterwards.
<hatter> anwaways, Tempest II is a completely different story
<hatter> It uses EM (electromagnetics) in conjunction with ES (electron spectroscopy) to not only pinpoint, but also alter, actions not limited to :
<hatter> Viewing your screen, mouse movements, disk i/o (read/write), ram usage, and CPU usage.
<hatter> Usually an improper use, or a misuse of TEMPEST II will result in temporary hardware failure, similar to an EMP
* Shiny has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
<Fox> now
<hatter> the difference is that misuse of TEMPEST II will only result in the temporary disabling
<Fox> Just to clarify with the EMP
<hatter> Not perminant disabling
* figgybit has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
<hatter> EMP is permanent
<hatter> TEMPEST II misuse
<hatter> is temporary
<Fox> I know
<hatter> just reboot your system
<hatter> However
<Fox> I was clarifying that it kills battery
<hatter> If you're still in range of the TEMPEST (Usually 20 to 30 feet)

* VanKrause (~lol@cocks.dongs.and.anal.holes) has joined #school4lulz
<hatter> Yes it does fucking DESTROY battery.
<hatter> If you have a battery in a laptop
<hatter> that gets hit by tempest 2
<hatter> Take it out
<hatter> Just throw it
* figgybit (~whatsthis@LulzCo-D6241CCF.c3-0.avec-ubr2.nyr-avec.ny.cable.rcn.com) has joined #school4lulz
<hatter> Use your power cable
<hatter> much more reliable
<hatter> In any case, those are their preliminary information gathering points.
<hatter> They'll record emitted radiation, emitted electromagnetism, as well as emitted networking (they can MITM your ISP, no big deal)
* hatter sets mode -m #school4lulz
<redEye> is this the real content of the class?
<hatter> Yep
<hatter> This is when a JTF tackles you.
<Fox> This is information from experience.
<hatter> Joint Task Force
<hatter> If a JTF tackles you
<hatter> you only have two hopes
<hatter> and you need them both
<kratos> hatter: 
<hatter> sup kratos 
<hitler> how widely is this used?
<kratos> this stuff is used only after surveillence
<kratos> of the person
<hatter> This is typically used in third stage
<kratos> it's more likely that a hacker will be confronted with physical tracking
<hatter> when they've already got you in their sites, you already fled from the law
<kratos> before it reaches that
<hatter> when they've already got you in their sites, you already fled from the law
<hatter> when they've already got you in their sites, you already fled from the law
<hatter> when they've already got you in their sites, you already fled from the law
<jester> sights*
<hatter> ^
<Fox> Now 
<Fox> To clarify
<jester> or if youre me, they have me in their sites
<jester> ;D
<hatter> You are correct kratos 
<Fox> for those just joining us
<kratos> but it's important to identify when you are being physically followed
* hatter gives voice to kratos
<Fox> This is a class on protecting yourself from all sorts of nastiness
* hatter sets mode +m #school4lulz
<Fox> Federal Agents, Task forces, Rival Crews
<hatter> ^
<kratos> ie checking for monitoring equipment on your car or parent's cars, checking your house for anything that's been moved or changed
<Fox> We are preparing you to be sent off on your own.
<hatter> 00:36 <+kratos> ie checking for monitoring equipment on your car or parent's cars, checking your house for anything that's been moved or changed
<hatter> Very correct
<hatter> however even ditching that equipment
<hatter> doesn't make you safe.
<hatter> Which is what this class is for
<kratos> and also being aware of anybody around you, especially if they appear to follow you over long distances
<hatter> This is for the perma-fucked, ultra-paranoid.
<kratos> yeah
<hatter> 00:36 <+kratos> and also being aware of anybody around you, especially if they appear to follow you over long distances
<hatter> One good trick that I learned from Fox actually
<Fox> :3
<hatter> Is throwing some blank cd's and hdd's out of the car
<hatter> if they're following you in a moving vehicle
<hatter> their primary objective will be to obtain evidence
<jester> looool
<kratos> haha
<hatter> they don't know if you're canning evidence
<hatter> or if you're just throwin shit out there
<hatter> so they gotta pull over 
<kratos> well, i don't know if they'd fall for that, enough to take it when you're in their view
<hatter> Fox: What was it?  10?  14?  something like that?
<kratos> besides, they typically 'box' you
<Fox> Rofl
<Fox> kratos
<Fox> Wrong
<Fox> Hatter mind if I step in for a second?
<hatter> kratos: you're correct, you underestimate my driving
* Mac (~chatzilla@7CD30C03.9D752112.EE98B35.IP) has joined #school4lulz
<hatter> Fox: go ahead.
<Fox> Now we're all familiar with the 'eyeball' scenario
<Fox> 2 without sight lines, and 1 with or 2 with
<Fox> Depending on the amount of people involved
<kratos> yes
<Fox> now the thing is, with highway travel, or city travel
<Fox> this is often too conspicous
<Fox> so, what they will do if they lack air support
<Fox> will be to create choke points
* Endiss (~Endiss@LulzCo-9E41B2A.wgnet.pl) has joined #school4lulz
<Fox> where people will be at intersections
<kratos> true
<Fox> which could be called a box, but eyeball is usually the term used
<Fox> A box would refer to all 4 having a potential sight line
<kratos> although these days, they also have drones, which is another possibility
<Fox> This is usually not the case.
<kratos> the fact being that they don't neccessarily need people on the ground to follow you
<Fox> Ontop of this surveillance in most interstate travel can be an issue.
<Fox> Cameras on travel signs
<kratos> i was meaning a floating 'box', fox, with a remote c&c 
<Fox> No worries, that's proper
<Fox> Now another thing that I've learned
<Fox> is a huge thing with traveling while tailed or potential tailed
<Fox> Gas Mileage, and night time are your best friends.
<Fox> Most surveillance vehicles for the most part are large beefy vehicles, or lower end models with equipment.
<Fox> So
<Fox> Suburbans, Escapes, Econolines, et cetera.
<kratos> ^
<Fox> Now
* EndzO (~EndzO@LulzCo-262C7ECD.abhsia.telus.net) has joined #school4lulz
<hatter> Don't forget about pathfinders!!!!!
<Fox> Thank you
<Fox> Now don't think you got it cause you see none of these
* Medusa (~Victoria@BC74D05.D2B206B7.7E52A797.IP) has left #school4lulz
<Fox> that just means they're not gathering evidence at the time
<Fox> I'm about to wrap up here, and let hatter take over again for a minute
<Fox> But the one thing I have to stress
<hatter> kso basically
<hatter> your electronics go down, you don't be active for a while
<hatter> Assume sniffers are there
<Fox> is that you need to trust your instincts here.
<hatter> If you've been using the same coffee shop for a while
<Fox> If you FEEL something wrong, then change up. Immediately.
<hatter> and you've been switching your mac every time
<hatter> doesn't matter
<kratos> and yet, another thing, is don't let them know you know if possible
<kratos> if they know that you know, they'll change tactics to try to make you feel safe, again
<kratos> better an enemy you know than one you don't
<hatter> ^
<hatter> kratos is quite right
<hatter> But even if you know 
<hatter> if you've been using the same area
<hatter> for a while
<hatter> and you see that guy
<hatter> with his cold coffee
<hatter> reading the paper
<hatter> GET THE HELL OUT.
<kratos> yes, it's good to change it up, but keep it subtle
<hatter> ^
<hatter> I've seen a guy pretending to drink a cold cup of coffee before
<hatter> That meant that I fucked up to begin with
<hatter> by using the same location more than once.
<t> you should never use the same place twice let alone goto the coffee shop every morning b4 work to jerkoff on your laptop
<hatter> They don't even try to cover that shit up
<hatter> Like, you'll see the rings on the inside of the coffee cup
<t> another thing is if its early morning and started raining and you notice one person dry but everyone else wet
<hatter> ^
* Medusa (~Victoria@BC74D05.D2B206B7.7E52A797.IP) has joined #school4lulz
<t> basic shit that you wouldnt normally look for
<hatter> t: take it away, need a cig break
<t> k one sec ogtta piss
<Fox> Fine.
<Fox> Anyways
* agentblagojevic has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
<Fox> Now some of the big things we're discussing here, is that there are feds in this channel right now
<Fox> So a little more about how you should conduct yourself
<Fox> One of the big things is that you're going to have people try and get at you
<Fox> "Hey whats up I got some CVV"
* svelte (~svelte@LulzCo-AF9BED75.hsd1.fl.comcast.net) has joined #school4lulz
<Fox> Learn to identify when people are being too earnest.
<Fox> Learn to identify when people are trying to trap you into a sentence
<kratos> as usual, do
<Fox> When you side step a question and someone persists, and change language, 
<Fox> REALIZE THAT IMMEDIATELY.
<kratos> don't talk about these things with anybody you don't trust^ *
* renzor_ (~renzor@LulzCo-5D7A2F03.dsl.hol.gr) has joined #school4lulz
<vicki> learn to identify when people ask you question when they don't NEED TO KNOW the answer.
<vicki> OPSEC = NEED TO KNOW.
<Fox> OPSEC = Operations Security
<Fox> Big thing.
<vicki> thx
<Fox> Now
<Fox> Our next class that I'm participating in will be on cultivation of contacts
<Fox> You don't necessarily want to be scared shitless of the feds
<Fox> But you don't want to play nice
<kratos> most of them are just normal guys doing their jobs, to be honest
<Fox> Exactly.
<kratos> and will get pretty pissed if you make things too difficult for them
<Fox> Well
<kratos> so you want to let them do their thing, while you do your thing, but professionally
<Fox> That depends
<vicki> like attacking senate.gov and asking if this is an act of war?
<vicki> :)
* mr (~mr@1D80A41C.F7A7C2E9.334BF441.IP) has joined #school4lulz
<kratos> just don't punch the guy with the rings in his coffee
<kratos> lol
<Fox> It's really a matter of how you handle business.
<kratos> apart from seeming really paranoid, it just won't help, even if they are FBI or whatever
<hatter> vicki: pretty much
<Fox> There are multiple types of Digital Hustlers here.
<hatter> ^
<vicki> well i can only stress one thing: do NOT try to copy lulzsec. unless you really fkn know what you are doing (which means you know EVERYTZHING we say here)
<hatter> ^
<jester> guys
<jester> i wanna start a group
<hatter> If you want to go baller
* hatter removes channel half-operator status from jester

<hatter> you gotta really really really know how to cover your ass
<Fox> A few who stack paper quietly and handle business
<Fox> and a few in between.
<hatter> as the fist part of covering your ass
<hatter> means not leaving tracks to begin with
<hatter> Don't leave any tracks, there's nothing to cover.
<hatter> Your enemy will do anything to get at you once they know who you are
<hatter> they are unscrupulous
* renzor has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
<Fox> Now a little bit of etiquette for you.
<Fox> Note there is a honor amongst thieves system.
<Fox> Or at least some people adhere to it.
<t> also if your a 350lb asshole whos 19 and already bald dnt think that hot asain bitch coming up to wants the dick she wants to get inside your place
<kratos> DO NOT EVER EVER GRASS 
<Fox> There are lines that you cross when beefing with someone.
<kratos> ANYBODY TO THE FEDS FOR WHATEVER REASON
<Fox> kratos
<Fox> sh for a sec.
<Fox> Now
<Fox> Rules:
<Fox> You go after family. You better be ready to bury someone.
<Fox> You snitch, you WILL be found out, and that measly few G's they offered will be taken out on your ass and your credit report a thousand fold
<Fox> You snitch, and I ever see you at a conference, please do trust that I will give your face a fuck up that you've never seen before.
<Fox> Won't eat solid food for a month.
<hatter> ^
<kratos> ^
<hatter> I'll help too
<hatter> lol
<Fox> Shit's getting rough.
<hatter> N believe me 
<hatter> You don't want me up your face
<Fox> You need to learn to protect yourselves.

<Fox> ^^
* clu (~clu@LulzCo-4044EA2D.hsd1.co.comcast.net) has joined #school4lulz
<Fox> Anyways
<Fox> Another big ordeal is other crews.
<kratos> that may not share your ethics
<Fox> Lets say you've gotten yourselves a few people here
<Fox> Right?
<Fox> You decide to start stepping on some toes
<Fox> Fuck 'em right? You learned shit here.
<Fox> Wrong.
<hatter> ^
<Fox> You start getting in crew-crew or crew-person drama
<Fox> you better have your shit on point.
<Fox> Your accounts, your servers, your LIFE.
<Fox> Because crew wars are fucking relentless.
<Fox> It is truly the sense of warfare, there are casualties, there are a lot of problems
<Fox> And one thing to remember
<Fox> is you never know who you're talking to.
<Fox> So that innocuous statement you made to me about your area code?
<Fox> Guess what
<Fox> I now have your locale to start digging.

<jester> if you have experience with social engineering
<jester> its very very simple to fill everyones head with disinformation

<jester> make small comments about a place you arent from
<jester> let people question everything you say
<nachash> jester = dead on
<Fox> Now another piece of information
<Fox> I'm on a road trip right
<Fox> everyone knows this
<Fox> But
<Fox> Where am I really
<jester> in your moms basement
<jester> with #swag
<Fox> As I said
* Fox has kicked jester from #school4lulz (Your behavior is not conducive to the desired environment.)
* jester (~root@pluto-a.nasa.gov) has joined #school4lulz
<Fox> The best part about that
* FlipRez has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
<Fox> is that I can get into the middle of the country
<Fox> and disappear.
<Fox> Anyone that had a problem with me, and was digging
<Fox> Now they're back at square one.
<nachash> There are still a lot of blank spots on the map. Use them some time.
<Fox> Indeed
<Fox> Anyone here know of any of the big crew battles from back in the day?
<kratos> and when you do disappear, learn something new and get really involved in it

<t> uhhh ohhh
<Fox> Would you like to school the kids on some folk lore?
<nachash> That's like the biggest crew war ever.
<God> i am God
<Fox> Kids, we're about to teach you about your roots.
<jester> the best disinformation is a lie that you keep up for years at a time
<jester> something very basic
<hatter> I am a former member of the MoD.
<God> super mad cow?
<jester> that everyone "knows" about you
<hatter> anyone who doesn't believe me can leave or just ignore my comments.
<God> the cult of the dead cow
<jester> lol
<hatter> is not the same thing as the MoD God 
* hatter removes channel half-operator status from God
<hatter> quit interrupting the lesson
* hatter gives channel half-operator status to God
<hatter> in any case
<hatter> Watch yourself with crews
<hatter> If you snitch on anyone, or if someone things you snitched, you'll run into another Eli vs. Chris situation
<hatter> Btw by that I mean
<hatter> Acid Phreak vs. Erik Bloodaxe
<hatter> Erik Bloodaxe was snitching the MoD out to the feds
<hatter> And Acid Phreak picked up on the ONGOING CALL
<hatter> And said "Yeah, we're comin for your ass bitch"
<hatter> Hence, this year is the first year that Eli/Acid Phreak has been allowed to touch computers
<hatter> or any other telecommunications device

<Fox> Don't wreck snitches on sight
<hatter> Uck...

<jester> indeed
<hatter> You can actually use them for misinformation
<Fox> DING DING DING DING
<Fox> STRONGEST
<Fox> FORM
<Fox> OF MISINFORMATION
<jester> theres a difference between snitches and people with law enforcement ties
<jester> the latter is the best ally

<jester> youd be surprised what a friend with ties will be willing to let you know
<Fox> A snitch 
<Fox> = Someone who is on a fed's dick.
<kratos> yes
<Fox> Jr G man shit.
<Fox> a Friend with LE ties
<Fox> = 
<kratos> who you KNOW (not just suspect) is on the fed's side
<hatter> ^
<kratos> there have been misunderstandings in the past
<Fox> Much broader spectrum, this could be someone who has been picked up in the past

<Fox> Lots of potentials in the latter
<kratos> true
<Fox> And

<nachash> Gonzales played both sides, but ultimately became a snitch when it came time to choose sides.
<nachash> he still got 20 years.
<nachash> uT got 2.
<Fox> Now for those of you here with political sides.
<whiteh8> ouch
<nachash> That's another thing, kids. He who talks the least, gets the least time.
<Fox> whiteh8 is going to give you a little bit of information
<nachash> uT denied everything, even with logs on his own box that said otherwise.
<nachash> He said he wrote some sniffer, but claimed he didn't know he was going to be used for evil.

<Fox> whiteh8 go
<Fox> boys are handling business
<whiteh8> well im not exactly prepared, but a lot of people will take on causes
<whiteh8> prepare to actually meet with people face to face
<whiteh8> if you can be in touch with non-tech activists who will work with you as boots on the ground, then all the better
<whiteh8> they can disrupt private meetings, infiltrate close-knit organizations
<whiteh8> there are a lot of dangerous groups out there, who would do bodily harm if they found you out

<whiteh8> a few years ago, some national socialists in the pacific northwest murdered some guy because they found out he was anti-racist/anti-fascist

* hatter gives voice to figgybit
<whiteh8> it just depends how old you are
<whiteh8> i was 17; told my parents i was going to a LAN party 
<whiteh8> i didn't raped and/or murdered so i guess it worked out alright?
<jester> social engineering is how you con people
<sigma> watch out for unmarked cars and whatnot though if you're meeting buddies from IRC.
<jester> but the terms are not interchangable
<whiteh8> but you can meet people at places like defcon, 2600 (watch out for these guys, though)
<jester> if you know how to social
* IranianChaos (~IranianCh@LulzCo-38223486.hsd1.tx.comcast.net) has joined #school4lulz
<jester> you know how to manipulate and disinform whoever you wish
<eni> http://www.social-engineer.org/framework/Computer_Based_Social_Engineering_Tools:_Social_Engineer_Toolkit_%28SET%29
<jester> unless you have a reputation of a liar, people will believe what you say
<whiteh8> i'd say that's safer; HOPE, DefCon, 2600, b-sides, etc.
<God> there podcasts are awesome
<whiteh8> try and arrange friends to meet you here and you'll have a cool place to hang out and common stuff to do
<God> some of the best podcasts ive listened too
