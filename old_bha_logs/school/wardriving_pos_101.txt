Wardriving POS 101 (by Snafu)

<Snafu> Yaay
<Snafu> I got some interesting shit
<Mutiny> did the peanuts show up in it
<Mutiny> ?
<Mutiny> or the corn?
* EmilyPlays (d5770f7b@LulzCo-5910E532.mibbit.com) has joined #school4lulz
<Snafu> figured id bring it here from the lulzsec room
<Snafu> Wifi_101
<Snafu> So here we go
<Mutiny> #shitjokes
* Dorpher has quit (Quit: Rizon webchat: http://qchat.rizon.net/)
<Snafu> This is from my observations in the US, not sure how other countries are
<Snafu> This encompasses PCI DSS and WIFI networks attached to POS networks
<Snafu> So there ya are, wardriving
<Snafu> You see an ESSID that matches the business name….Well use Subway for this lesson
<EmilyPlays> Hai guize
<Snafu> Subway because its very common there…..they franchise..
<Snafu> Anyways
<Snafu> Most subways have a wifi network so the owner can check his corporate emails and such
<Snafu> And of course, the dude will follow whatever is recommended
<Snafu> Hell if u check the verizon mifis they RECOMMEND wep
<Snafu> wtf right?
<Snafu> So anyways
<Snafu> If yer lucky, youll find a WEP encryption
<Snafu> Now
<Snafu> How do you know if you have gotten a proper network ?
<Snafu> Find the gateway (cough) 192.168.1.1 most likely
<Mutiny> Another neat fact… Technician installed AT&T routers at home locations are by default not encrypted at all.
<Snafu> then syn flood it with hping3 or whatever
<Snafu> Anyone not familiar with syn floods?
<Snafu> anyone curious how to syn flood?
<iyobe> yes
<hjax> sort of
<Snafu> Okay
<Snafu> Moving on
<Snafu> So
<Snafu> Syn flood the router
<Snafu> Now, for this method, u need to be in view of the register
<Snafu> Not fam with synf loods?
<Snafu> sb1
<Snafu> i dont memorize it
<Snafu> one sec
<Snafu> hping -i u1 -S -p 80 dst-host-or-ip
<Snafu> ie
<d0z3> nice
<Snafu> hping -i u1 -S -p 80 192.168.1.1
<turnigy> whos to say it would take down the service?
<Snafu> hping –help to learn what the option syntaxes are
<Snafu> A syn flood?
<Snafu> Gimme yer IP =)
<Snafu> ill show ya
<Snafu> =)
<d0z3> whats the purpose ? taking it down ?
<Snafu> Alright, now with that being said, You have to view the register
<crklol> >2011
<crklol> >syn flood
<Snafu> Set up the command, but dont hit enter yet
<Snafu> U dont want to cause suspicious activity
<Snafu> wait till someone is getting rdy to pay
<Snafu> watch what they pull out of their wallet
<Snafu> If its plastic
<Snafu> begin the flood
<hjax> what are we using the syn flood against?
* wa- has quit ()
<d0z3> the gw of the lan
<Snafu> if they swipe multiple times….yer good
<Snafu> stop the flood
<Snafu> the gateway
<Snafu> To prevent traffic from leaving the local subnet
<Snafu> ie
<Snafu> the 16 digit credit card number
<hjax> at a store?
<d0z3> subway store, hacked wifi, youre on the wifi
<Snafu> So anyways, what youll normally get is a 16-yr old cashier with pimples and a confused look because they have to keep swiping the card, and its not working, but they arent getting errors
<Snafu> Most of the time, they will hit the reader because they are unintelligent
<d0z3> lol
<Snafu> As soon as you see the confused look, or multiple swipes, Probably both at the same time
<Snafu> STOP the syn flood
<hjax> lol
<Snafu> Do not DDoS the network, or they might call in a technician
<d0z3> the suspense, i can’t hold myself
<d0z3> so.. arp spoof ? :d
<hjax> it would totally lock up the network? fun
<Snafu> after youve verified that the syn flood stops transactions…..MITM via arpspoof or whatever
<d0z3> yay arpspoof :d
<Snafu> yep
<d0z3> cain!
<Snafu> nice d0z3
<Snafu> oh yeah
<Snafu> syn fludz are fun
<crklol> ethreal
<Snafu> so now what u need to do is find the mac of the reader
<xoxo> (i’m logging this)
<Snafu> so u cause less traffic than a mass arp
<Snafu> ie
* Bob_Robster (~Bob_Robst@C7189919.712D1C05.C199F532.IP) has joined #school4lulz
<Snafu> you dont want to slow down the store owners child porn downloads
<Snafu> go for it
<Snafu> =)
<Snafu> he might get suspicious
<Snafu> so for those who dont know
<Snafu> apt-get install arpspoof
<Snafu> arpspoof -i wlan0 -t 192.168.1.2 192.168.1.1
* iro (~iro@LulzCo-226F28F8.dynamic.chello.sk) has joined #school4lulz
* xoxo has quit (Quit: Leaving)
<Snafu> -t is the target
<turnigy> snafu, getting the mac of the reader? nmap?
<Snafu> Now, heres the trick
<Snafu> that is a one way spoof
* Bob_Robster has quit ()
<Snafu> yep
* ryan1918 has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
<Snafu> or ettercap
<Snafu> or both
<Snafu> whatever =)
* xoxo (~xoxo@EB88FA99.F20FE4F0.3582744B.IP) has joined #school4lulz
<Snafu> many methods here
<Snafu> Let me backup a bit
<d0z3> heh i’m glad i run the wifi in a seperate vlan at work :p
<Snafu> nmap 192.168.1.0/24 -sn
<hjax> what would happen if i tested it against my home network? just stop traffic for my entire family?
<Mutiny> or try to login to the gw using the default information XD
<Snafu> that does a ping sweep on the network
<xoxo> (could somebody paste the lines I missed? it’s for the loggin’)
<Snafu> I can briefly recap
<Snafu> Thatll be good
<Snafu> cuz im getting lost in my thoughts reading everybodies questions
<crklol> xoxo,
<crklol> * xoxo è uscito (Quit: Leaving)
<crklol> <Snafu> -t is the target
<crklol> <turnigy> snafu, getting the mac of the reader? nmap?
<crklol> <Snafu> Now, heres the trick
<crklol> <Snafu> that is a one way spoof
<crklol> * Bob_Robster è uscito ()
<crklol> <Snafu> yep
<crklol> * ryan1918 è uscito (Remote host closed the connection)
<crklol> <Snafu> or ettercap
<crklol> <Snafu> or both
* ryan1918 (~ryan@7016F228.B696884D.7E210C26.IP) has joined #school4lulz
<crklol> <Snafu> whatever =)
<Snafu> coo, thanks crklol
<crklol> np
<xoxo> i’m gonna sync it up a lil
<Snafu> grabbing a dip, one sec, afk
<Snafu> ill just backtrack a bit
* bob has quit (Quit: laters)
<Snafu> thatll make it make sense
<Snafu> now that i see what questions i missed, order is always nice
<Snafu> 123 instead of 1583737 then 2
<Snafu> so
* sublimepua has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
<Snafu> WEP and POS networks
<Snafu> we could speak WPA, but why not go for the low hanging fruit
<d0z3> (use airocrack or cafe late)
<Snafu> Do some wardriving
<Snafu> find a network with an ESSID that matches the business (this is so you dont hit the wrong people and waste time)
<Snafu> ie subways
<Snafu> they are always almost normally improper setup per PCI DSS rules
<Snafu> thats the payment card industry
<Snafu> Data security standards
<Snafu> fun rules
<Snafu> 5000 dollar a day fines for improper networks with wifi
<Snafu> Okay
<Snafu> So
<Snafu> U find a subway with wep
<Snafu> u can also use signal strength to determine a network
<Snafu> whatever
<Snafu> crack the wep open like an egg…..then
<Snafu> yer gunna need to test if the wifi is on the POS part of the network
<Snafu> How to do this is by syn flooding the gateway
<Snafu> most networks thats the 192.168.1.1
<Snafu> to find it another way would be to ipconfig /all
<Snafu> in windows
<Snafu> or route -en in *nix
<Snafu> if u dont know what a gateway is, well, google =)
<turnigy> tip: if you don’t, forget this.
<Snafu> so, you need to prevent traffic from going out of the network
<Snafu> to do this create a syn flood
<Snafu> via hping or whatever method
<Snafu> i use hping
<Snafu> it works
<Snafu> field tested
<Snafu> hping3 to be exact
<Snafu> here is the syntax
<Snafu> hping -i u1 -S -p 80 dst-host-or-ip
<Snafu> where dst-host-or-ip is the gateways ip
<Snafu> hping –help to figure out what the optional syntaxes are
<Snafu> i choose port 80 because the router will normally have 80 open so that the owner can surf the kiddie pr0n
<Snafu> So
<Snafu> With yer handy netbook, grab u a sandwich, sit down, eat for a bit, and then wait for someone to get rdy to pay
<Snafu> have the commands typed already
<Snafu> watch what thye pull out
<Snafu> if its plastic begin the flood
<Snafu> The effect is instantenous
<Snafu> so dont have it running for long
<Snafu> the goal is NOT TO DDoS at this point
<Snafu> maybe later
<Snafu> but not now
<Snafu> So, if u see the clerk swipe more than once and have a confused look on his face
<Snafu> U got it
<Snafu> The reader wont show errors because it is transmitting properly
<Snafu> itll say Waiting on confirmation or whatever
<Snafu> because it is sending the data up the pipe
<Snafu> So thats where u get the confused look from
<Snafu> cuz normally its like 4-5 seconds for a response with a cat5 cable hooked in
<Snafu> longer if its telephonics, but then it prolly wouldnt work anyways cuz its not on the subnet of the wifi
<Snafu> so after you have seen multiple swipes, stop the flood
<Snafu> dont wait too long
<Snafu> or the customer will pull out cash
<Snafu> or a diff card
<Snafu> all about timing
<Snafu> you want to see that u delay it
<Snafu> and then see that the same card goes through
<hjax> what would happen if theres more than one cash register?
<Snafu> thats the litmus test part of it
<Snafu> Good question
<Snafu> Never thought about it like that
<crklol> wait, isnt the shit of the card cripted?
<hjax> would it lock up all of them?
<Snafu> but since youll be syn flooding the gateway
<Snafu> it shouldnt matter
<Snafu> itll prevent traffic from leaving…..maybe not coming, but def leaving
<Snafu> Yep
<Snafu> SSL
<Snafu> but theres a cure thanks to moxie marlinspike
<Snafu> but thats later
<Snafu> ..
<Snafu> Okay so
<Snafu> You have verified that the WiFi is the same subnet as the POS
* jester[znc] is now known as jester
<Snafu> Yep
<Snafu> totally prevent traffic outgoing
<Snafu> never done intensive syn flood testing to see what happens to all machines outbound/inbound
<Snafu> but it definately prevents outbound traffic
<Snafu> okay so
<Snafu> Now you need the MACs of the gateway and the readers
<Snafu> i suggest: nmap 192.168.1.0/24 -sn
<Snafu> assuming its a 192.168.1.1 type networks
<Snafu> use whatever works for u
<Snafu> then using a mac looker upper
<Snafu> google “mac address lookup”
<Snafu> first or second hit is the page u need
<Snafu> either way
<d0z3> cant u just arp -a since you just pinged ?
<kratos> ^
<Snafu> the firs 6 digits of the hex addie are the manufacturer
<Snafu> u could
<Snafu> but u only attacked the gateway
<Snafu> not the reader
<d0z3> yeah but you did an nmap ping sweep
<Snafu> so why would u have arp traffic to the reader?
<d0z3> so you arp’ed every ip
<d0z3> and should have gotten a reply
<Snafu> =)
* ratch3t (~androirc@LulzCo-FC117E60.sub-174-253-235.myvzw.com) has joined #school4lulz
<Snafu> Oh
* ratch3t has quit ()
<kratos> or you could use hping and ethereal to craft an arp req and cap the reply
<Snafu> thought u meant after the flood
<Snafu> yes
<Snafu> You are correct
<Snafu> figured u meant dir after the synflood, vs after the nmap sweep
<Snafu> method is not important
<Snafu> What u need is a list of macs on the subnet
<Snafu> after u got them
<d0z3> after the nmap 
<d0z3> ok
<Snafu> look for ones that arent laptop normal
<Snafu> ie
<Snafu> hell i cant even think of one now
<Snafu> but it wont be atheros or hp etc…
<Snafu> so using those macs
<Snafu> take the first 6 digits of the 12 digit address
<turnigy> nmap does a good job of figuring it out, what device etc
<Snafu> and look em up
<Snafu> when u find one that deals with POS, u got a target
<Snafu> sometimes
<Snafu> but yer only -sn it
<Snafu> So
<Snafu> Now you have the mac of the gateway and any card readers
<Snafu> Really you only need to do a oneway spoof
* tzaki has quit (Quit: Leaving)
<Snafu> from the reader to the gateway
* Zion has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
<Snafu> but if you want other infos
<Snafu> youll need a twoway
* zdanthrax has quit (Quit: Leaving)
<xoxo> Snafu: could you give the command for spoofing?
<Snafu> ettercap -Tq -i wlan0 -M arp:remote /192.168.1.1/ /192.168.1.3/
<xoxo> ty
<Snafu> arpspoof -i wlan0 -t 192.168.1.3 192.168.1.1
<Snafu> thats a one way though
<Snafu> ettercap -Tq -i wlan0 -M arp:remote /192.168.1.1/ /192.168.1.3/
<Snafu> would be twoway
<Snafu> which is more ideal
<Snafu> and you see both sides of the equation
<Snafu> vs just the traffic FROM the reader
<Snafu> or using ettercap for a oneway woudl be this way
<Snafu> ettercap -Tq -i wlan0 -M arp:oneway /192.168.1.1/ /192.168.1.3/
<Snafu> okay so, now with the twoway being recommended
<Snafu> Ah, forgot
<Snafu> The reason i use ettercap is for packet forwarding purposes
<Snafu> If you are using arpspoof u have to do it manually
<Snafu> with this method
* leak has quit ()
<Snafu> #!/bin/bash
<Snafu> #Not using the old ways anymore, ettercap all the way
<Snafu> #echo “1″ > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
<Snafu> echo “Define Forwarding Port”
<Snafu> read a
<Snafu> iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp –destination-port 80 -j REDIRECT –to-port $a
<turnigy> everyone should know this…but to add, change your freaking mac first
<Snafu> exit
<Snafu> theres my script
<nachash> And preferably use a wifi card you don’t care about, in addition to changing your mac.
<Snafu> ah wait
<Snafu> hmm
<Snafu> yes u are right turnigy
<Snafu> we are teaching =)
<Snafu> Change yer hostname too
<Snafu> thatll be in the logz
<Snafu> as well
<nachash> There’s no such thing as paranoia.
<crklol> ettercap rules
<Snafu> Okay so backing up just a bit here
<Snafu> You need to enable packet forwarding, OR you will DOS whatever u are spoofing
<Snafu> echo “1″ > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
<Snafu> to enable packet forwarding
* TimmyTingles has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
<Snafu> But, if u use the above script, youll see where i talk about ettercap and its commented out
<Snafu> So i dont really use arpspoof
<Snafu> cuz ettercap is more powerful
<Snafu> either way
<kratos> if you use iptables, you’ll need to p
<kratos> ermit forwarding as well
<Snafu> Ah, a note
<Snafu> If you use arpspoof
<Snafu> and want to read the dumps with Ettercaps -T option (text)
<Snafu> make sure you invoke the unoffensive
<Snafu> You do not want to forward twice
<Snafu> My iptables are defaulted kratos
<Snafu> so im not sure what ya mean
<Snafu> how i do forwarding is the echo “1″ > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
<Snafu> i dont issue any iptables commands to do it
<Snafu> Do u know something i dont sir?
<kratos> the forward chain must be set to ACCEPT
<Snafu> and yeah xoxo ill kick when finished
<Snafu> hmm
<kratos> just a mention
<Snafu> never had a problem in ubuntu or backtrack
<kratos> i use complex firewalls though 
<kratos> and DENY all generally
<Snafu> ah
<kratos> just something to watch out for
<Snafu> I dont use any when attacking
* gaybaby (~g@yba.be) has joined #school4lulz
<Snafu> takes elements out of the equation
<Snafu> Okay
<Snafu> Noddles
<Snafu> So if you use firewalls
<Snafu> make sure you dont prevent forwarding
<Snafu> thats the lesson to get out of that
<Snafu> Alright
<Snafu> So
<Snafu> a recap on the spoofing
* turnigy has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
<Snafu> if you use a method other than ettercap to spoof
<Snafu> MAKE sure you enable packet forwarding
<Snafu> In conjunction with that
* janick (~qwerty@LulzCo-C71354B7.desu.edu) has joined #school4lulz
<kratos> and if you have any trouble, check you have all the iptables modules compiled in your kernel
<kratos> alongside ip forwarding
<Snafu> make sure if you decide to read traffic with ettercaps -t option, and you have enabled forwarding via the echo “1″ > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
<Snafu> that you set ettercap to Unoffensive
<Snafu> this is in the man page for ettercap
<Snafu> how to invoke ettercap unoffensively?
<Snafu> ettercap -Tu
<Snafu> Touche’ kratos
* turnigy (~turnigy@9E450AF4.1F24E4E4.13FC21DA.IP) has joined #school4lulz
<Snafu> Any questions so far?
<Snafu> Sorry if this has been long winded…..
<Snafu> alright
<Snafu> Now, we are currently: mitm the router/gateway (2-way preferably)
<phed> this db im dumping i think is looking well over 6k users in email/telephone/full name/address/password plus possibly other shit i cant see outside the scroll of the screen lol hopefull some cc in there
<phed> all uk english twats lulz
<Snafu> Next we want to do two things
<Snafu> Grab authentication cookies
<Snafu> And SSLStrip
<jester> omg pheds
<Snafu> To grab cookies, I like to use Ferret&Hamster
<kratos> more of a #lulzsec topic there phed
<Snafu> syntax on this is
<Snafu> ferret -i wlan0
<phed> do my bros not want some lootin first in here lol??
<Snafu> open that in  a diff text window, cuz it will spam the screen with all sorts of chatter
* ryan1918 has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
<kratos> ssh, let Snafu teach
<Snafu> but leave it running
<Snafu> You might get some cool stuff….Specially if you arent just mitm the tgt and the gw, but the whole network
<Snafu> Alright, now with ferret running
<Snafu> Youll need to do some iptables configuring
<Snafu> echo “Define Forwarding Port”
<Snafu> read a
<Snafu> iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp –destination-port 80 -j REDIRECT –to-port $a
<Snafu> exit
<Snafu> you can script it if you like
<Snafu> I left off the top half for simplicitys sake, cuz i talk about using ettercap and such

<Snafu> Aright, with that command, its going to move yer packets from 443 over to 80
<Snafu> using SSLStrip
<Snafu> anyone here not used sslstrip?
<Snafu> anyone here used it?
<crklol> never used it
<crklol> seems cool
<Snafu> Moving on.
<Snafu> Heh
<Snafu> Its a blast

<Snafu> wow

<Snafu> alright
<xoxo> Mutiny: but it fucks up the log you know
<Mutiny> i retract that statement
<Snafu> SSLStrip
<Mutiny> you can cut it out
<crklol> (you should put +m here=
<crklol> *)
<Snafu> It makes port 443 port 80 by some magik
* r0yale (~r0yale@LulzCo-C1DBF51B.ok.ok.cox.net) has left #school4lulz
<Snafu> anyone know why we want 80 vs 443?
<Snafu> 80 is cleartxt =)
<Mutiny> 80 is standard open for http
<Mutiny> ?
<Mutiny> i was wrong.
<Snafu> so are other fun ports….23…etc
<Snafu> Yep
<Snafu> but its also cleartext
<Snafu> Yer proper Mutiny
<Snafu> it is http standard
<Snafu> What does http do though with “user info”?
<Snafu> Sends it cleartext across the wire
<kratos> you could open an ssl server on port 80 but your browser would go insane
<Snafu> If this was my network i’d show you a dump of an sslstrip extract, but its not mine to mess with right now
<d0z3> um its not coz you portforward 443 to 80 thats its gonna get decoded .. ?
<Snafu> This applies to ANY network and ANY situation, not just subway wep networks with a POS attached
<Snafu> well, 443 is standard for https

<d0z3> so your gonna give the cardreader a new ssl cert ?
<iwrg9jh> decrypted*
<KroaK> its doesn’t
* iro has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
<Snafu> SSLstrip is magik bro
<Snafu> nope
<KroaK> it give the victim a fake ssl cert
<d0z3> ok thought so
<Snafu> this is not like ettercaps fake ssl cert shit
<d0z3> real mitm
<crklol> ah ok KroaK
<Snafu> This is a redirector
<turnigy> most users will click ok to security warnings in browser
<turnigy> 
<Snafu> the victim doesnt see ANYTHING
<kratos> http://www.thoughtcrime.org/software/sslstrip/
<Snafu> in this case, they dont get the warning
<d0z3> this isn’t a user but an embedded device 
<Snafu> yep
<Snafu> Moxie
<crklol> but didnt the app “for the card” need to accept the NEW cert?
<Snafu> Awesome
<Snafu> Noddles
<Snafu> which is why we cant use fake ssl replacement here
<Snafu> we need the reader not to be asked questions
<Snafu> SSLStrip works like this
