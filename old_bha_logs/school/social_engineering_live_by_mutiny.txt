<Mutiny>	Okayyyy
<Mutiny>	Let's get started
<Mutiny>	I'm going to talk about Social Engineering and ways to protect
yourself from it.
<Mutiny>	This isn't going to teach you how to social engineer, but
rather, what you should watch out for.
<Mutiny>	As usual, message an op (other than me) for voice
<Mutiny>	So I'm going to start with the very basics.
<Mutiny>	What is Social Engineering?
<xochipilli>	the science of manipulating people
<xochipilli>	to get what you want
<Mutiny>	Precisely.
<Mutiny>	Social engineering focuses on perception and persuasion.
<Mutiny>	They try to get you to think they are someone of authority, of
power.
<Mutiny>	They try to persuade you into giving up information that you
shouldn't give up
<Mutiny>	So think to yourself in advanced
<awkward>	basicaly using people stupidity and trust against them
<Mutiny>	"What might cause me to give out information that I shouldn't.
What might someone do that would persuade me to do so."
<Mutiny>	Then, watch for that.
<Mutiny>	Social engineers prey on qualities of human nature. These
include the desire to be helpful, the tendency to trust people, and the fear
of getting in trouble.
<Mutiny>	So it doesn't matter how strong your password is, or how
secure you think your computer is.
<Mutiny>	If your password is too long, you'll probably write it down,
and trust that your little note to yourself will be found.
<Mutiny>	If it's too short, expect your password to be bruteforced.
<Mutiny>	If it's too easy, learn what makes a strong password.
<Mutiny>	If you don't change it regularly, you may as well just remove
the password all together.
<Mutiny>	>.>
<Mutiny>	You might use some awesome encryption, but that doesn't stop
me from persuading you into giving me your passphrase because "I'm from IT and
need to verify something"
<Mutiny>	Your password is your password for a reason.
<Mutiny>	Now, when conversing with a social engineer, they are going to
do as much as they can to get you answering questions
<Mutiny>	So just be a pain in the ass and ask questions back.
<Mutiny>	If someone asks you for questionable information
<Mutiny>	ask why
<Mutiny>	verify who they are
<Mutiny>	make them explain it to you
<Mutiny>	A social engineer wants to rush the conversation
<Mutiny>	because the longer they are in a conversation
<Mutiny>	the more likely it is that they will be found out.
<Mutiny>	A good social engineer may be patient, a great social engineer
may not even sweat any of your questions.
<Mutiny>	It just depends on how bad they want the information.
<Mutiny>	And before you think to yourself
<Mutiny>	"Oh well they were confident, it didn't sound like they were
lying"
<Mutiny>	just forget about it
<Mutiny>	A social engineer, a real social engineer, not just a
prankster, might/probably will practice
<Mutiny>	They will practice until they are confident in the role they
are going to try to play.
<Mutiny>	Ignore how confident they sound.
<Mutiny>	Don't trust people.
<Mutiny>	For any reason.
<Mutiny>	Anyways, on to the various avenues of attack.
<Mutiny>	Social Engineers will focus on the human element of security.
This isn't to say they will only try things over the phone though
<Mutiny>	We'll start with phone calls and move out from there.
<Mutiny>	If someone from my phone company calls me telling me something
might be wrong, and asking me to verify such and such information
<Mutiny>	I ask their name
<Mutiny>	and the department they are in
<Mutiny>	and an employee identification number
<Mutiny>	I hang up
<Mutiny>	Call the company back using the official phone listing either
in a phone book or on their website
<Mutiny>	And ask to speak to "TheirName in TheirDepartment"
<Mutiny>	A few things will happen at this point
<Mutiny>	"Sorry sir, we don't allow transfers to specific employees,
but perhaps I can assist you"
<Mutiny>	This will get you in touch with a company contact that can
verify if anything is wrong with your account.
<Mutiny>	Or "We don't have anyone named so&so in that department"
<Mutiny>	In which case you saved yourself.
<Mutiny>	Or
<hatter>	lol
<Mutiny>	"Ok I'll transfer you right away" means that they really were
legit, and you can just carry on as if your hardware had some technical
problems
<Mutiny>	Either way, you've been cautious and alert.
<nachash>	Try to get to the actual person, if they exist.
<Mutiny>	^
<nachash>	Good SE types will get real contact info on someone in a
company
<nachash>	And hope you can't pierce the veil of bullshit
<Mutiny>	That's why we want to sharpen our spears and be looking out
for that veil ;)
<Mutiny>	There are other methods of attack that you should be aware of
as well.
<Mutiny>	You'll probably laugh now
<Mutiny>	but Dumpster Diving is a legitimate avenue of attack
<Mutiny>	People get careless
<Mutiny>	and throw away things that may have confidential information
<Mutiny>	or personal informatoin
<Mutiny>	information*
<Mutiny>	Instead of shredding/burning/some other method of securely
disposing of it.
<Mutiny>	If someone really wants access to something, I wouldn't put
this past them.
<Mutiny>	It could also just be a random kid trying to find information
on various people, looking for a random attack.
<Mutiny>	For example: Whenever I use an ATM, I burn the receipt to the
point where nothing can be seen anymore.
<Mutiny>	Then I rip it and throw it in the trash
<nachash>	Back in the 80s, a lot of kids liked to dumpster dive their
local central office to find telco publications that had been discarded.
<Mutiny>	^
<nachash>	Just to give this a historical example
<awkward>	i dont even take the atm receipt
<Mutiny>	awkward: Some of the ATM's I've used automatically print them.
Otherwise I also don't take it.
<awkward>	true
<Mutiny>	So dispose of important information properly
<Mutiny>	A paper shredder now may cost a bit
<Mutiny>	but it will save you
<Mutiny>	in the long run
<xochipilli>	or
<xochipilli>	eat all the confidential paper
<xochipilli>	:3
<Mutiny>	You could do that XD
<xochipilli>	youll get a little
<xochipilli>	blocked up
<xochipilli>	around day 2
<xochipilli>	dont be discouraged
<Mutiny>	Ok so that pretty much covers dumpster diving. People will
find shit on you, people will use it.
<xochipilli>	XD
<xochipilli>	sorry, continue
<Mutiny>	Shoulder surfing
<kratos>	or just stick it on a fire, if you want to get oldschool, but
some inks are as bad as toner for cancer
<Mutiny>	is my personal
<Sav>	low end paper
<Sav>	like
<Sav>	that drinks a lot of water
<Sav>	is more easily eaten
<Sav>	or
<Sav>	cooked
<Sav>	or
<nachash>	^^^
<xochipilli>	omgomgomg
<Sav>	whatever
<xochipilli>	whats that paper
<xochipilli>	FLASH PAPER
<xochipilli>	everyone get flash paper
<nachash>	Bookies used to use paper that dissolved easily in water.
<xochipilli>	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrocellulose
<Mutiny>	See, there are lots of ways to dispose of your information
securely.
<nachash>	If a raid came down, they just threw the books in a 55 gallon
drum of water
<xochipilli>	flash paper is like that, nachash 
<xochipilli>	cept u burn it
<xochipilli>	it burns in like .1s
<nachash>	Boom, instant evidence destruction
<xochipilli>	like a flash
<Sav>	and
<Sav>	is unstable
<Sav>	and dangerous
<kratos>	not something you want under your arm on a sunny day
<kratos>	walking past smokers
<nachash>	This had the added bonus of them being able to tell the
winners, "We got raided, and destroyed the books. Sorry."
<nachash>	And just keeping the money
<kratos>	but sorry Mutiny, shoulder surfing, go on...
<Mutiny>	Anywhooooo. Shoulder surfing is my personal favorite attempt
for someone to get my information.
<Mutiny>	It just makes me laugh.
<Mutiny>	A bad shoulder surfer
<Mutiny>	will stand over you and pretend to read a book or a newspaper
or something stupid
<Mutiny>	Don't input any sensitive information if there is anyone
behind you
<Mutiny>	Nuff said.
<kratos>	A good one might set up a camera
<kratos>	or something behind your cubicle
<kratos>	maybe just lean over talking to somebody else
<Mutiny>	Even if you have one of those screen protector things, people
can still see
<Mutiny>	I can watch someone type in their password and 9 times out of
10 I can tell at the very least the length of their password and a list of
keys it contains
<Mutiny>	just by watching the keyboard
<Mutiny>	If you want to make this a little harder for people to do
<Mutiny>	Buy blank keycaps :3
<kratos>	and if it's somebody who works with you, through these
half-glances they could have your password in a couple of days
<Mutiny>	People can get information through many quick glances over a
long period of time
<Mutiny>	so just beware
<kratos>	one idea might be asking them for a telephone number just
after if you think they were watching you
<kratos>	starting a discussion, so they can't go back and write it down
<Mutiny>	If someone is looking, or you think someone might be looking,
exercise caution
<Mutiny>	Now
<Mutiny>	It's important to note
<Mutiny>	that there is a computer side of social engineering as well.
<Mutiny>	Emails
<Mutiny>	spam
<Mutiny>	malware
<Mutiny>	etc
<Mutiny>	A compromised email account will send mail just the same as a
normal email account
<nachash>	IMs, too.
<kratos>	and social networking accounts, now
<nachash>	I've used IM accounts that girls let me borrow to pump
e-stalkers for info.
<Mutiny>	if someone asks you for information over email, look for a way
to contact them via phone. Tell them you don't feel comfortable releasing such
information via internet
<nachash>	But you've got to be pretty leet at copying typing styles for
that
<Mutiny>	Yeah when i say "email" i guess it really applies to all sorts
of internet comm
<kratos>	and be aware of anybody who adds you on facebook, myspace,
AIM, MSN or whatever
<Mutiny>	OK LISTEN UP
<Mutiny>	IF SOMEONE ADDS YOU
<Mutiny>	AND YOU DON"T KNOW THEM
<Mutiny>	PRESS DECLINE
<kratos>	DEM
<kratos>	DENIED*
<Mutiny>	BECAUSE NO ONE
<Mutiny>	GIVES TWO FUCKS
<Mutiny>	ABOUT HOW MANY FRIENDS YOU HAVE
<Mutiny>	K?
<kratos>	^x100000000000000
<Mutiny>	Anyways
<Mutiny>	If someone contacts you online asking for sensitive info
<Mutiny>	try to get ahold of them via phone
<Mutiny>	don't ask them for a number
<Mutiny>	find the number in a phone book or their website
<nachash>	^^
<Mutiny>	call the company they claim to be from
<Mutiny>	and ask to talk to them
<nachash>	My father once got socialed by someone like that
<nachash>	They called him from a spoofed number
<nachash>	And claimed all this bullshit
<nachash>	I told him it sounded like somebody was messing with him
<nachash>	The number went to a direct auto insurance office in another
state.
<nachash>	But it wasn't auto insurance related.
<nachash>	Reverse any business numbers you're given. If it's an unlisted
or cell phone number, beware.
<nachash>	But still, do as Mutiny says and look them up properly.
<Mutiny>	See, shit can be manipulated to make you THINK it's legit
<Mutiny>	You always want to talk to at least one other person from the
business that the potential attacker is claiming to be from
<Mutiny>	So that mostly covers internet communication
<Mutiny>	don't disclose sensitive shit
<Mutiny>	Now
<Mutiny>	Spam/malware/etc, as i mentioned, can be used to get info
<Mutiny>	an attacker plants a keylogger
<Mutiny>	something
<Mutiny>	like that
<Mutiny>	First
<Mutiny>	ALWAYS check your USB ports before booting up
<nachash>	^^
<nachash>	The government uses tamper-evident cases because of shit like
this
<Mutiny>	I've keylogged co-workers simply to prove to my boss how
vulnerable they were.
<nachash>	If someone cracked it open and installed something, it's going
to be obvious
<Mutiny>	But, if your hardware is all normal
<Mutiny>	Then
<Mutiny>	Don't click shit.
<Mutiny>	Don't install shit.
<Mutiny>	If you're on windows, you better have file extensions always
showing. Otherwise you can an hero.
<Mutiny>	Scan things when you download.
<Mutiny>	Scan them before opening
<Mutiny>	No matter if it claims to be a jpeg or a pdf or whatever
<Mutiny>	scan it
<Mutiny>	Basically
<Mutiny>	Just wear a condom while you surf the internet. You don't want
to get AIDS and die.
<Mutiny>	If you don't wear a condom online, you WILL get AIDS and DIE
<nachash>	And people will point and laugh at you
<Mutiny>	So all that being said, lets make it brief. Anyone who says
they are someone, get identification.
<Mutiny>	Never speak your password over the phone. If they are in tech
support for real, they don't need your password.
<Mutiny>	Don't EVER write your password down and leave it on a sticky
note on the monitor, or under the keyboard, or stuck to the bottom of your
desk/chair/lamp.
<Mutiny>	If you don't have caller ID, you can buy a new phone for like
$20. Being able to see the number you get a call from is important.
<Mutiny>	If you don't have means of properly disposing of documents,
get yourself a paper shredder. It's worth it.
<Mutiny>	Any questions?
<droid>	what about people who block their numbers on caller ids?
<zetareticulan>	can has speak?
<Mutiny>	Droid
<nachash>	droid, just don't answer.
<Mutiny>	^
<Mutiny>	If they block their number, they aren't legit.
<nachash>	I always take the following stance
<zetareticulan>	So by participating in late enrollment, how are you granted
access to any materials you missed?
<nachash>	"You're unavailable? So am I"
<Mutiny>	zetareticulan message fox
<Mutiny>	or hatter if you've already paid
<lovely>	dont say ur name if you take an unknown call. just say "hello
whos there"
<nachash>	^
<nachash>	Never give up any info
<Mutiny>	If you have a voicemail that says your name
<Mutiny>	get rid of it
<lovely>	!word
<nachash>	If they ask who you are, just be like, "Who are you? You
called me."
<Mutiny>	"You've reached 867-5309, please leave a message."
<rode0s>	its simple, watch your privacy....dont puke info
<nachash>	Use the generic shit that has a robot read off your number if
at all possible.
<nachash>	Then they can't even get a voice sample
<Mutiny>	^
<nachash>	Depending on your level of paranoia, this can be useful
<rode0s>	paranoia lvl 10
<hatter>	 /win 144
<Fox>	Sup
<nachash>	People have wrecked lives in the past by taking words and
stitching them together to say incriminating things.
<Fox>	I 
<Fox>	BROKE
<Fox>	PAYPAL.
<nachash>	lol
<Fox>	That is all.
<Mutiny>	Ok I'm going to go over a few signs to look for when dealing
with sketchy situations. More info can be found on the log that will be
posted.
<Mutiny>	--Signs of a social engineer:
<Mutiny>	Refusal to give contact information.
<Mutiny>	Rushing the conversation.
<Mutiny>	Name-dropping.
<Mutiny>	Intimidation.
<Mutiny>	Small mistakes.
<Mutiny>	Requesting any forbidden information.
<Mutiny>	This is security we're talking about.
<Mutiny>	Sec - U - R - IT -y.
<Mutiny>	You're the weakest link, and attackers know this.
<Mutiny>	You'll be targeted.
<Mutiny>	Undoubtedly.
<Mutiny>	So watch out.
