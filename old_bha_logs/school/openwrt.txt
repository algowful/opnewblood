*	Sav sets mode +m #school
<Fox>	on murder and drugs
<Sav>	Ok
<Fox>	we cant do that
<Sav>	instead of that
<Fox>	rainbows?
<Sav>	they'll get a class on OpenWRT and vpn pool
<Sav>	or poop
<nachash>	Fox: Can we make a channel to talk about murder/drugs shit?
<nachash>	I propose #anarchy
<Fox>	done.
<Sav>	shhh
<Fox>	#murder
<Fox>	***
<nachash>	lololol
<Fox>	#murda
<Sav>	ok
*	Sav sets mode -q #school Fox
*	Sav removes channel operator status from nachash
<Sav>	:D
<hatter>	sup Sav <3
<Sav>	so
<Sav>	nm
<Sav>	promised a class this morning
<Sav>	will be giving it now
<Sav>	I had planned one
<Mutiny>	go ahead sav, i need to go get some shit done
<Sav>	this morning
<Sav>	(morning for me)
<hatter>	Sav: go for it
<hatter>	:)
<Sav>	OK
<Sav>	so
<Sav>	We'll be studying OpenWRT and how to set it up as a VPN gateway for
your computer
<Sav>	please pm another op if you want voice
<Sav>	as usual
<Sav>	This has several advantages, the main one is that little or no trace
of configuration can be found on your computer
*	droid has quit (Ping timeout)
<Sav>	and an OpenWRT router like the WRT54GL is something very small and
easy to dissimulate and shit, so in case a thief comes home and wants to rob
your secrets he won't be able to easily find that one
<Sav>	so, the advantages, little configuration on your computer, tinyness of
the hardware, and overall, it's damn flexible
<Sav>	As an example, on my WRT54GL I have a pool of 3 VPNs for diverse use
<Sav>	2 americans, 1 for hulu, 1 for gmail.
<Sav>	1 australian, for Kangaroo Dance.
<Arsis>	Sav: pros/cons of that vs paid vpn?
<Sav>	these ARE paid vpns
<Sav>	just they're not directly set up on my computer
<Sav>	the advantage of that is that your non-secure traffic can go through
your normal gateway
<Sav>	while your more sensitive traffic can be routed through your VPN
gateway, without having to fiddle with your local host's network config
<Sav>	another advantage is with this method is is damn easy to chain VPNs
<Sav>	with very little route configuration
<Sav>	So
<Sav>	Step 1/ download openwrt, I have a preference for backfire.
<Sav>	and tbh been having it for like 1 year, and it's perfect
<Sav>	Step 2/ strip it down. Disable the DHCP server (rtfm)
<Sav>	ok
<Sav>	we're tfm
<Sav>	so we'll give you a lecture :)
<Sav>	first steps to strip it down, opkg list
<Sav>	on my box, currnetly, there's 40 packets
<Sav>	I disabled the httpd there was by default, a long while ago
<Sav>	and activated, ofc, dropbear, the embedded ssh server
<Sav>	you will need the following packages to have functional pptp vpn
through your OpenWRT router
<Sav>	ip (provides iproute2 utilities), ppp, pptp and srelay
<Sav>	srelay is a SOCKS5 proxy, that you'll be using for connecting, but
that's the later part
<smeagol>	PPTP is known to be a faulty protocol. The designers of the
protocol, Microsoft, recommend not to use it due to the inherent risks. Lots
of people use PPTP anyway due to ease of use, but that doesn't mean it is any
less hazardous. The maintainers of PPTP Client and Poptop recommend using
OpenVPN (SSL based) or IPSec instead.
http://pptpclient.sourceforge.net/protocol-security.phtml to read about why to
not use pptp
<awkward>	why do you use 3 VPNs and hulu, gmail have seperate?
<Sav>	this is personal matter and is of no technical interest
<Fox>	Alright
<Fox>	oop
<Fox>	sorry
<Sav>	smeagol: it is a functional, lightweight and efficient protocol, plus
we use GRE over it, it does the work.
<smeagol>	umm heh
<smeagol>	ok
<Sav>	we're talking of a box with 4MB dynamic disk space and 16 MB RAM
<Sav>	I can't use ipshit on it
<smeagol>	yes, and supports openvpn
<Sav>	which takes a fuckton diskspace
<smeagol>	and doesnt suck ;)
<kratos>	note that you can use a spare PC instead of a consumer router
with OpenWRT, all you need is a linux/freebsd distro on it, a couple of nics
(or wireless AP card) and a modem (dsl or cable etc.)
<Sav>	pptp doesn't suck.
<smeagol>	but ok, please continue
<smeagol>	yes, it does, i supplied a link about its suck-factor
*	hatter removes voice from smeagol
<hatter>	continue Sav 
<awkward>	this setup is mainly for home use or for using in public wifi
spots?
<Sav>	pptp works and is used like everywhere. Hole my fuck out and prove it
sucks
<Sav>	for home use
<xochipilli>	yeah
<Sav>	because you don't want random ppl to use your vpn
<xochipilli>	openvpn is much bitchier
<Sav>	OK, so let's go on
<Sav>	strip down your OS
<Sav>	remove all the useless crap
<Sav>	httpd, wifi, whatever you don't use, you trash
<Sav>	then you install ppp, pptp, srelay
<Sav>	then
<Sav>	you configure your chap-secrets
<Sav>	it's a plaintext file which contains the following field
<Sav>	username PPTP password ppp-server-ip-address
<Sav>	I have 3 VPNs so there's 3 lines I filled in in my file
<Sav>	then, you need to configure your peers
<Sav>	http://slexy.org/view/s20qFu9LXI > an exemple peers file
<Sav>	the peers are to be put in /etc/ppp/peers/ for ease of use
<Sav>	you name then like "myvpn", "myothervpn", "thethirdone"
<Sav>	w/e
<Sav>	the name ... field has to correspond with one info in your
/etc/ppp/chap-secrets file
<Sav>	now, take time to put aside the IPs of the VPN servers you'll be
using, you'll need this
<Sav>	the plan, now, is to set static routes to the vpn servers through the
main gateway, call all the vpn providers, and set a default route going
through it
<Sav>	for this, I have prepared a script in /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/ that I called
"routes
<Sav>	"
<Sav>	my script looks like
<Sav>	#!/bin/sh
<Sav>	ip ro add 93.182.146.2 via 192.168.0.254
<Sav>	ip ro add 208.91.134.130 via 192.168.0.254
<Sav>	ip ro add 180.189.157.92 via 192.168.0.254
<Sav>	ip ro add 64.120.244.162 via 192.168.0.254
<Sav>	ip ro replace 0.0.0.0/0 dev ppp0
<Sav>	192.168.0.254 being the iface for my DSL router.
<Sav>	by default, all my traffic will go through the ppp0
<Sav>	that is, the first I called
<Sav>	this will make sure my VPNs don't nest by default
<Sav>	if I want them to nest
<Sav>	I just have to use something like (if I did it in interactive CLI)
<Sav>	ip ro replace 208.91.134.130 dev ppp0
<Sav>	(considering 208.91.134.130 is not the address to the ppp0 VPN
provider)
<Sav>	this is somethign I didn't test much this far, but it can work w/o
problems afaik
<Sav>	now the power of this setup
<Sav>	is in the fact that all VPNs are constantly up
*	d3v0n has quit (Ping timeout)
<Sav>	if you want to change IP, you just
<Sav>	ip ro replace 0.0.0.0/0 dev pppX
<Sav>	and 
<Sav>	ip ro flush table cache
<Sav>	put this in a script and you're the winner
<Sav>	I've put this in /usr/bin/switchvpn
<Sav>	#!/bin/sh
<Sav>	ip ro replace 0.0.0.0/0 dev $1
<Sav>	ip ro flush table cache
<Sav>	I call it as switchvpn ppp1
<Sav>	and magically my routes are updated
<Sav>	Now
<Sav>	using it
<Sav>	it's another matter
<Sav>	You need to get something like Portable Firefox
<Sav>	or Firefox, period, or any other user agent that will let you
configure a proxy independently of the OS
<Sav>	and on the OpenWRT, you need to start the srelay thingie you had just
installed
<Sav>	my srelay.conf is:
<Sav>	root@ruth:~# cat /etc/srelay.conf
<Sav>	# allow local subnet to access socks proxy
<Sav>	192.168.0.0/24 any -
<Sav>	(because my home network is 192.168.0)
<Sav>	I configure Firefox very simply: go to
Options/pReferences/Advanced/Network
<Sav>	and fill only the "SOCKS 5 proxy" inputs
<Sav>	with SOCKS Host: the IP of your OpenWRT router
<Sav>	and port: 1080 (that's the default socks port)
<Sav>	try it and it'll work
<Sav>	now you'll run into trouble maybe because of RAM use
<Sav>	so
<Sav>	kill the syslog
<Sav>	and the klog
<Sav>	and modify your /etc/init.d/boot script
<Sav>	replace
<Sav>	 if [ -x /sbin/syslogd ]
<Sav>	by
<Sav>	  if [ -x /sbin/syslogd && false ]
<Sav>	this will disable the startup of syslog and crap
<Sav>	my router used to crash sometimes with big web traffic, I couldn't
read the output but I supposed it was swappiness
<Sav>	since there's no swap
<Sav>	it just crashed silently
<awkward>	do you turn the vpn off for personal legal stuff? or can it be
on all the time?
<Sav>	it is on all the time
<Sav>	the advantage of this setup
<Sav>	is that the traffic that doesn't go through the socks5 proxy
<Sav>	goes out with my public IP
<Sav>	as, when working for customers, publishing websites, reading my bank
accounts
<Sav>	all this comes from my public, well known IP
<Sav>	only more sensitive traffic goes through VPN
<Sav>	that is
<Sav>	I ssh over the router
<Sav>	by bouncing on it
<Sav>	(I could use a socks5 compatible ssh client, I suppose puTTY supports
this)
<Sav>	and my web traffic in Firefox goes through it
<Sav>	while Chrome uses my standard gateway
<Sav>	there's absolutely no change in my computers' network config
<Sav>	just the router is altered
<Sav>	let me pastebin you one ps aux
<Sav>	to show you how stripped down it is
<Sav>	http://slexy.org/view/s21QaRdDUW
<Sav>	I modified the /etc/init.d/srelay file to add the -m 16 option
<Sav>	because I want to have maximum 16 processes running
<Sav>	if you do that, guys
<Sav>	you will gain in flexibility
<Sav>	efficiency
<Sav>	ease of use, seamlessness
<Sav>	and general comfort of use
<Sav>	it's no use getting through a VPN if you have to spend 5 mn changing
your network config every time you want to switch IP
<Sav>	with this solution, it's as simple as a single command line
<Sav>	and most often it will be done transparently
<Sav>	for sure continuous protocol program swill have to open new sessions
<Sav>	but for the web, it's seamless
<Sav>	so
<Sav>	using OpenWRT + ppp + vpn + srelay + a Web User Agent that supports
SOCKS5, your life becomes easy
<Sav>	we could even imagine, if you didn't care, to load balance traffic
between your VPNs. This would require packet marking in iptables
<Sav>	(this could take up a lot of RAM, so I don't recommend it on such
simple machines)
<Sav>	and a small knowledge of policy routing
<Sav>	like you create 3 routing tables
<Sav>	one for each of your VPNs
<Sav>	you randomly mark packets 1,2, or 3
<Sav>	and you add rules
<Sav>	ip ru add fwmark 1 lookup vpn1
<Sav>	ip ru add fwmark 2 lookup vpn2
<Sav>	ip ru add fwmark 3 lookup vpn3
<Sav>	and the non-marked packets go through your default config
<awkward>	but for hardcore stuff you should still use public wifi + vpn
+ tor? or this setup is secure enough?
<Sav>	this setup can become more secure
<Sav>	by chaining VPNs
<Sav>	preferably VPNs from different providers
<Sav>	and from differnet countries
<Sav>	to chain them
<Sav>	you have the route to the pptp server of one
<kratos>	and rotating with a cronscript
<Sav>	go through the established connection of the other
<Sav>	rotating with a cronscript would break a lot of things kratos 
<kratos>	it depends, if you had a pre-up and pre-down for each vpn
<Sav>	or you can mark certain protocols, depending on port number, as "non
stateful"
<Sav>	and these would be dynarotated
<Sav>	you can't have one for each VPN
<Sav>	you have one global for ppp
<Sav>	well
<Sav>	I guess you could play with environment and shit
<Sav>	to detect what provider you're calling
<kratos>	well you'd have one master script that'd call other scripts
<kratos>	if you get me
<Sav>	but this gets beoynd the scope of the course
<Sav>	yup
<Sav>	still it has to detect :)
<kratos>	mm might be a bit of work :)
<Sav>	would be interesting, but I don't trust the 54GL for this work
<kratos>	indeed, that's why running a spare PC as a router is better
imo
<Sav>	it's like , hmm, it is lacking RAM
<Sav>	yup
<Sav>	but 
<Sav>	power consumption
<Sav>	noise
<kratos>	that's true
<Sav>	it's cumbersome
<kratos>	have you seen pandaboard?
<Sav>	you have like only I iface
<Sav>	1 iface most often
<kratos>	yes
<Sav>	nope didn't
<kratos>	but with a wireless card, some more ifaces and a dsl/cable
modem
<kratos>	it'd do the job better :)
<kratos>	search it up, pandaboard
<Sav>	yeah
<Sav>	but a 50$ router
<Sav>	is not a 300$ computer
<kratos>	you get what you pay for :)
<kratos>	pandaboard is 150$
<kratos>	iirc
<kratos>	it's just a mobo
<kratos>	small-sized and fairly extendable, no hd just SD
<kratos>	etc
<Sav>	and I like the service the $50 router provides, with 5 eth ports and a
WiFi AP
<Sav>	you can mod it
<Sav>	to add a cf reader
<Sav>	and it's easy to like tear it off
<Sav>	and change its packaging
<kratos>	sure
<kratos>	you could maybe even extend RAM
<Sav>	this gets more touchy
<Sav>	:)
<kratos>	i've heard of people chaining ram 
<Sav>	ther's the WRT4GS
<Sav>	which is IIRC 64MB RAM
<Sav>	or something
<Sav>	32
<kratos>	yeah
<Sav>	21:22 <Tyrone> poast this: Fags, get an old laptop, strip it down, its
cheap as hell and has a built in UPS (battery).
<Sav>	21:23 <Tyrone> Also silent, low power.
<Sav>	I get i nprivate
<Sav>	21:23 <Tyrone> And an attached keyboard so you can give it the 3
fingered salute.
<Sav>	I don't exactly agree because laptops are like reliable as shit, get
hot as fire and fail as simon cowell
<Sav>	but, well, it's a possibility
<discussion>
<Sav>	questions? 
<kratos>	that's true. there's also other boards on offer, not just the
panda. hackaday.com or similar will have boards for $50-$500 that will be
perfect for basing a router on, a lot of them have low power consumption and
are perfectly expandable
<Sav>	Mutiny: you'll be able to give your class.
<Sav>	yup
<Mutiny>	I'll postpone a little bit just to give everyone a break
<Tyrone>	A laptop will cost you anywhere between $0 and $50 tough.
<Tyrone>	And a dualcore will hardly run hot with a stripped down gentoo
install runnin' openvpn.
<Sav>	just the 54G is a consumer market product, like found at the next door
shop, you can hook one up and have it running in 10 mns, mine is like 25°C
<Sav>	and it boots in 8s
<Sav>	or 10 on bad days
<Sav>	since it is a simple machine, I won't have it run a fuckton of useless
programs, ircd, lol-screen, and such
<Sav>	for this I have my servers.
<Sav>	and now
<Sav>	for your culture
<Sav>	I urge you to read this:
http://pptpclient.sourceforge.net/protocol-security.phtml
<Patri0t>	^
<prophet>	< logging everything as well if you want raw lecture
<Tyrone>	Small pptp explanation, and why it is shit, for n00bs.
<Tyrone>	Let's assume best case, mschapv2.
<Tyrone>	This happens on connection initiation.
<Sav>	yup
<Tyrone>	Server sends challenge->user encrypts 8 byte challenge with 16
byte ntlm hash. adds 8 byte challenge of its own.
<Sav>	I wouldn't use pptp over a wifi network
<hatter>	lol
<Tyrone>	This gets sent to the server, server checks agains it's user
db if its correct.
<hatter>	ppp
<Tyrone>	So you have the plaintext, all you need is the key, you can
br00t.
<Tyrone>	Worst case: weak as shit MSCHAP-V1 Is used (check l0pthcrack
yo) shitty NT hash of your pass is broadcasted. BOOM, bruted.
<Sav>	NTLM, for people's information
<Sav>	is MD4
<Tyrone>	Oh, and if your program has compatibility between MSCHAP v1
and v2 auth, a MITM can force it down to one.
<Sav>	iirc
<Sav>	like
<Sav>	you can kill it in no time
<Tyrone>	yep, md4.
<Sav>	my sister had changed my brother's computer password
<Sav>	spawned ophcrack
<Tyrone>	you can reverse like what, half of that algorithm?
<Sav>	the password was like 11 chars long
<Sav>	got cracked
<Sav>	in 5 mn
<Tyrone>	Not to mention that for this case, a collision is fine too.
<Sav>	yup
<Sav>	so, people
<Sav>	an extra advice
<Sav>	don't use WiFi when possible
<Sav>	or use WPA
<Sav>	WEP is useless
<Sav>	WEP is like locking a door with a weak key
<prophet>	^
<Tyrone>	also, no WPA-PSK.
<Sav>	and hoping no one will break in and listen to everybody
<Spunker>	isn't WEP crackable via injection in like 5 minutes?
<Mutiny>	WEP is like installing a lock and forgetting to use it.
<awkward>	and leaving the key next to the door
<Sav>	WPA establishes individual locks
<Sav>	for each user
<Sav>	so it's harder to attack
<prophet>	WEP keys can be cracked from outside the network in a matter
of minutes usually
<Spunker>	I heard that WPA is crackable too 
<Spunker>	but only at a certain point in time
<LulzSheep>	are you still talking
<Tyrone>	EAP-EKE = best key algo.
<Spunker>	during the handshake phase or smth
<prophet>	Spunker, it is, but the key-strngth matters
<awkward>	if you use a shit password
<fortmefy>	there's a couple of things, like WEP migration mode.  However,
you're probably thinking about WPA/2-TKIP packet insertion
<fortmefy>	besides the obvious handshake bruteforce
<Tyrone>	try WPA/2-EAP-EKE plz.
<LulzSheep>	I am on WPA-Personal is that good
<Tyrone>	http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6124 <-EAP-EKE rfc.
<LulzSheep>	encryption type TKIP
<Tyrone>	tkip
<Tyrone>	lulz.
<Sav>	yeah
<Sav>	anyway
<Sav>	don't use wifi, because Eve's a bitch
<Sav>	(the crypto Eve)
<Sav>	my WRT54GL has no WiFi antenna
<Sav>	and no iw package
<Sav>	and no wifi kernel modules
<Mutiny>	Don't set a password on your router and completely forget what
you set it as.
<Mutiny>	>.>
<LulzSheep>	just roll with default
<Sav>	use a root password
<LulzSheep>	be an hero
<Sav>	haha
<Sav>	admin / admin
<prophet>	lawl
<Sav>	:>
<Mutiny>	I don't roll with default, but i derped and forgot what the
hell I set it as :-/
<prophet>	yes, for best security, use router defaults
<prophet>	:-P
<Sav>	the intruders will secure it for you
<Sav>	well
<prophet>	hahaha
<Sav>	they'll secure you out of it
