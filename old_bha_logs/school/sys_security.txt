System Security (by Laurelai and xochipilli)

[00:37] <%Laurelai> ok
[00:37] <%Laurelai> well
[00:37] <%Laurelai> one of the important things people miss
[00:37] <%Laurelai> is updating their software
[00:37] <@garrett> Omega: <3
[00:37] <%Laurelai> you can add a bash script to a cron job to auto update
[00:37] <%Laurelai> depending on your distro
03[00:37] * lolatu (Owner@ec-DC3B3377.hsd1.ca.comcast.net) has joined #school
[00:37] <%Laurelai> but make sure everythings up to date
[00:38] <%Laurelai> next is protecting the kernel
[00:38] <%Laurelai> the grsecurity patch is very very good for this
[00:38] <%Laurelai> if your hosting company doesnt use it or doesnt support custom kernels
[00:38] <%Laurelai> run away
03[00:38] * Spozm (Lord@ec-7F544397.no.no.cox.net) has joined #school
03[00:39] * Spozm is now known as Spozm|laptop
03[00:39] * qwert is now known as dsr
[00:39] <@Fox> Run far away.
[00:39] <%Laurelai> the grsec patch has a lot of options you can choose from based on your desired setup, however make sure to install gradm also
[00:40] <%Laurelai> now for RHEL based distros
[00:40] <%Laurelai> there is no rpm for this
[00:40] <%Laurelai> however i am currently working on one
03[00:40] * Fox sets mode: +v kratos
[00:40] <%Laurelai> it can be seen on github
[00:41] <%Laurelai> and of course you can compile from source
[01:02] <%Laurelai> anyways
[01:02] <%Laurelai> grsec
[01:02] <%Laurelai> now some people will tell you that all of the good parts have already been incorporated into the linux kernel
[01:02] <%Laurelai> those people are idiots
[01:02] <%Laurelai> looking at you linus torvaldis
[01:03] <%Laurelai> now if you have to compile from source
[01:03] <%Laurelai> be sure to incorporate the old .config
[01:03] <%Laurelai> it will have all of the modules you need to keep running after you reboot
[01:03] <%Laurelai> thats the biggest sorce of problems
[01:03] <%Laurelai> source*
[01:04] <%Laurelai> once you have done that you may need to tune up the policy with gradm
[01:04] <%Laurelai> depending on your infrastructure
[01:04] <%Laurelai> id advise reading the grsecurity documentation
[01:04] <%Laurelai> now with SElinux
[01:05] <%Laurelai> i dont reccomend it at all
[01:05] <%Laurelai> first of all the code was written by the NSA and i dont trust the code
[01:06] <%Laurelai> and second there have been a number of 0 days in the past that show it hasnt been audited to the level it should be
[01:06] <%Laurelai> so
[01:07] <%Laurelai> no SElinux
[01:07] <%Laurelai> now on to PHP
[01:08] <%Laurelai> one of the down sides of centOS is the fact they use older packages and just backport security updates
[01:08] <%Laurelai> http://rpm.oneechan.org/i386/
[01:08] <%Laurelai> as you can see here
[01:08] <%Laurelai> i have updated packages for centos
[01:08] <%Laurelai> also patched with something called php-suhosin
03[01:08] * Fox sets mode: +v Frosty
[01:08] <%Laurelai> http://www.hardened-php.net/suhosin/
[01:09] <%Laurelai> this is a good first step in protecing your web applications
[01:09] <%Laurelai> the second step is of course stop writing shitty php
[01:10] <%Laurelai> http://t.co/0OnR5Ff
[01:10] <%Laurelai> here is a good guide to stopping sql injection too
[01:10] <%Laurelai> one thing
02[01:10] * Hellspawn (kvirc@B4A95BE6.D8CEB73D.2BD6162F.IP) Quit (Ping timeout)
[01:10] <%Laurelai> that people argue over
[01:11] <%Laurelai> is php safe mode
[01:11] <%Laurelai> now i personally use it because i like many people use software i have not written myself, for example kusabax
[01:12] <%Laurelai> its not hard to get applications to run under safe mode, at the most it requires editing your php config
[01:12] <%Laurelai> and please make sure mysql is not running as root
[01:12] <%Laurelai> thats a dumb thing to do
[01:13] <%Laurelai> and just to make sure
[01:13] <%Laurelai> try sql injecting your site
[01:13] <%Laurelai> throw everything you have at it
[01:13] <%Laurelai> ask your blackhat friends to test it too
[01:13] <%Laurelai> you can never really be too paranoid about it
[01:14] <%Laurelai> another big thing is file permissions
[01:14] <%Laurelai> if you have a script laying around that runs as root and is world writable
[01:14] <%Laurelai> you just owned yourself
[01:14] <%Laurelai> if a script has to run as root
[01:14] <%Laurelai> chmod 700
[01:15] <%Laurelai> now the idea isnt to make anything hack proof
[01:15] <%Laurelai> because it just isnt possible
[01:15] <%Laurelai> there are 0 days and people who hold on to them and door source trees
[01:16] <%Laurelai> your owned
[01:16] <%Laurelai> 24/7
[01:16] <%Laurelai> the idea is to make it too hard for the average hacker
[01:16] <%Laurelai> and to move on to something easier
[01:16] <%Laurelai> oh
[01:17] <%Laurelai> and also keep offsite backups
[01:18] <%Laurelai> one last thing
[01:18] <%Laurelai> stop using passwords
[01:18] <%Laurelai> use RSA keypair authentication
[01:18] <%Laurelai> your passwords suck
[01:18] <%Laurelai> all of them
02[01:18] * Spunker (Spunker@ec-E4FE7FA7.ipredate.net) Quit (Connection reset by peer)
[01:18] <%Laurelai> keypairs are easy
[01:18] <%Laurelai> and they are pretty secure
[01:18] <%Laurelai> and disable password login
[01:18] <@xochipilli> ^ pubkey auth for everything, you will not regret
[01:18] <%Laurelai> you cant be ssh brute forced if it doesnt even accept a password
[01:19] <@xochipilli> if youre lazy you can unlock your key when you login
[01:19] <@xochipilli> if you leave your computer on all the time, might not be the best practice tho
03[01:19] * deadmau5 (deadmau5@CCAFBAF5.A0DD3AEC.18284D36.IP) has joined #school
[01:20] <@xochipilli> theoretically they could bruteforce the key, but its impractical
[01:20] <%Laurelai> yeah snowball in hell
[01:20] <@xochipilli> see also: a waste of time
[01:21] <%Laurelai> and another big thing i almost forgot
[01:21] <%Laurelai> if you dont use it
[01:21] <%Laurelai> uninstall it
[01:21] <%Laurelai> its just another 0 day waiting to happen
[01:22] <%Laurelai> i think thats about it
[01:22] <@xochipilli> btw for the more practically minded among you, i can login to any of my servers w/ 7 keystrokes,  because of pubkey auth and 2 character names in my ssh config
[01:22] <@xochipilli> 7 includes return
[01:23] <@xochipilli> just keep your key safe. it is symmetrically encrypted, but its easier to break that than to bruteforce your box
[01:23] <%Laurelai> yeah if your key gets taken
[01:23] <@xochipilli> new key
[01:23] <%Laurelai> even if its password protected
03[01:23] * ducksauce (amnesia@ec-892C1EBD.torservers.net) has joined #school
[01:23] <%Laurelai> change your keys
[01:23] <@xochipilli> assume its broken
[01:23] <@xochipilli> this is also why some types of keys will have expirations
[01:23] <@xochipilli> i dont *think* ssh keys do
[01:23] <+Frosty> the problem is. how do i know if my key is taken? not like it disappears 
[01:24] <%Laurelai> if you know
[01:24] <%Laurelai> or suspect
[01:24] <%Laurelai> also
[01:24] <@xochipilli> if you know your box has been compromised
02[01:24] * davispuh (Davis@E28C7CBB.6770A094.244D6A10.IP) Quit (Ping timeout)
[01:24] <@xochipilli> new keys
03[01:24] * dvector (dvector@ec-AE95276C.hsd1.ma.comcast.net) has joined #school
[01:24] <@xochipilli> ive seen DCs
[01:24] <%Laurelai> yeah
[01:24] <@xochipilli> pubkey auth to all their boxes w/ root
[01:24] <@xochipilli> passwordless key
[01:24] <@xochipilli> KEY TO THE CASTE
[01:24] <+Frosty> so something like a new key each week is a good habit?
[01:24] <@xochipilli> probably not necessary
[01:24] <%Laurelai> Frosty: it couldnt hurt
[01:24] <%Laurelai> but
[01:24] <%Laurelai> more like
[01:24] <%Laurelai> once a month
[01:24] <%Laurelai> every 3 months
[01:24] <%Laurelai> is ok
[01:25] <@xochipilli> depends on your level of paranoia
[01:25] <@xochipilli> haha
[01:25] <%Laurelai> and dont leave your private key on a server
[01:25] <%Laurelai> if it gets owned
[01:25] <@xochipilli> ^^^
[01:25] <@xochipilli> you can setup unix to fwd private keys
[01:25] <%Laurelai> they own your other servers too
[01:25] <@xochipilli> w/ kerberos
[01:25] <@xochipilli> tho im sure there are other ways
[01:26] <@xochipilli> so you can chain between your servers w/o keeping a key on each one
[01:26] <@xochipilli> also, if Laurelai didnt say this already NO ROOT SSH ACCESS
[01:26] <@xochipilli> EVER
[01:26] <@xochipilli> even w/ a key
[01:26] <%Laurelai> yeah its generally a bad idea
[01:26] <@xochipilli> even if someone manages to compromise a user account, they still dont have root
[01:27] <%Laurelai> if you lose your keys or something your hosting company should be able to get you in
[01:27] <@xochipilli> not the case if you use root for access
[01:27] <%Laurelai> so it might be inconvenient
[01:27] <%Laurelai> but its safer
[01:27] <%Laurelai> also an IDS is good
[01:27] <%Laurelai> but only if you pay attention to it
[01:27] <@xochipilli> if properly configured
[01:28] <@xochipilli> as well
[01:28] <@xochipilli> a poorly configured IDS will just waste your itme, and you will stop paying attention it
[01:28] <@xochipilli> pretty damn fast
