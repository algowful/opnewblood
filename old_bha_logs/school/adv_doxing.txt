Advanced Doxing (by Fox and nachash)

<Fox> [01:22:01] Fox: Our topic here is advanced doxing
<Fox> [01:22:19] Fox: I’m not getting into Lexis Nexus or account compromisation at this exact second
<Fox> [01:22:30] Fox: as it is currently part of our advanced curriculum
<Fox> [01:22:36] Fox: and as such I gotta stray away from it
<Fox> [01:22:38] Fox: so
<Fox> [01:22:43] Fox: what I’ll focus on just this second
<Fox> [01:22:51] Fox: is a little bit of account tomfoolery
<Fox> [01:23:02] Fox: and how to get info on an elsuive target
<Fox> [01:23:04] Fox: fuck…
<Fox> [01:23:09] Fox: I need to put the rum down
<Fox> [01:23:12] Fox: typos everywhere.
<Fox> [01:23:18] Fox: Anyways
<Fox> [01:23:32] Fox: Obviously from some other conversations we’ve seen that there is a lot that can be done with google
<Fox> [01:23:40] Fox: including grabbing full documents of a person
<Fox> [01:23:55] Fox: anyways, what we’re talking about here is that target that isnt easy to find, at all
<Fox> [01:24:03] Fox: Lets say for instance that you just have someones nick
<Fox> [01:24:05] Fox: right?
<Fox> [01:24:38] Fox: We would need to be able to get information out of them
<Fox> [01:24:51] Fox: Moment
<Fox> [01:24:53] Fox: Phone
<Fox> [01:24:55] Fox: talk if you like
<Fox> [01:25:29] Fox: Kay
<Fox> [01:25:38] Fox: well anyways, the kind of thing I’m talking about
<Fox> [01:25:43] Fox: is the trap…
<Fox> [01:25:56] Fox: The man, posing as a woman on the intertoobs.
<Fox> [01:26:06] Fox: Really, whatever you need to do to get this target to talk
<Fox> [01:26:16] Fox: I say a woman because as well all know
<Fox> [01:26:23] Fox: you faggots are miserable pieces of shit
<Fox> [01:26:31] Fox: and the slightest whiff of pussy sends you into a frenzy
<Fox> [01:26:58] Fox: (Side note: defense against it? Talk shit at them, and be demanding, better protection)
<Fox> [01:27:03] Fox: anyways
<Fox> [01:27:38] Fox: It’s really a matter of sliding into a role
<Fox> [01:27:48] Fox: 90% of social engineering is being a good actor
<Fox> [01:27:56] Fox: with text conversations it’s easy as fuck
<Fox> [01:28:08] Fox: if you posess a skill for writing higher than the average high schooler
<Fox> [01:28:15] Fox: then you’re fine.
<Fox> [01:28:28] Fox: Think of verbiage, tone, and what you say
<Fox> [01:28:37] Fox: Obviously in the beginning rather than just being like
<Fox> [01:28:52] Fox: OMG I WILL SEND U NOODZ TO UR CELL
<Fox> [01:28:57] Fox: WATS THE NUMBIR
<Fox> [01:29:21] Fox: Leaving open ended questions and statements in order to get the target to make their own decision is much better
<Fox> [01:29:28] Fox: right?
<Fox> [01:29:33] Fox: Right.
<Fox> [01:29:35] Fox: Example.
<Fox> [01:29:41] Fox: Who wants to hlep?
<Circumvent> me
<torify> haha
<Circumvent> 
<torify> =)
<Fox> Kay
<nachash> fox is dead on
<nachash> I once submerged myself in AOL’s lesbian chats for 3 months solid
<Fox> Let me wait to know everyone else has read
<nachash> And not once did I get outed
<prophet> read
<Fox> Ok
<Fox> So it’s about submerging yourself into a role
<Fox> Now circumvent
<curi0us> read
<nachash> Read a bunch of teenage girl writing if you need to get a feel for it
<eni> i hate sitting at the smog check place, its never skirt friendly.
<Fox> You don’t know whether I’m a boy, or a girl
<Fox> do you>
<Circumvent> no
<Fox> eni shitty
<Fox> take note
<Fox> It’s just so hard sometimes, being around here, I mean people don’t like taking advice from me because of who I am
* Shock has quit (Quit: Leaving)
<torify> wut?
<Fox> Just kinda shitty that people think because of the fact that I know what I’m doing that it’s assumed that I have to have a dick.
<Fox> Just silly sometimes, you know?
<Fox> Anyways Circumvent, tell me about your day?
<prophet> haha
<torify> okay i just thought this needs to be in quotes D: srz proceed
<Fox> Reading that.
<Fox> Did it click for any of you in this room?
<Circumvent> ur a girl
<Circumvent> reading that
<torify> ya
<Fox> You all just got, got.
<Fox> I could come in with a random nick
<Fox> and be whoever I needed to be
<nachash> ^
<Fox> If you were valuable enough of a target
<nachash> Also, be wary of anyone wanting to dcc shit
<Fox> I may spend months
<Fox> Listening to your shitty life
<nachash> And never click links
<Fox> Even doing filthy, disgusting fucking things
<nachash> That’s how Ips get exposed
<Circumvent> neer accept transfers?
<Fox> to earn your trust
<Fox> But guess what
<nachash> It’s all a mirage.
<Fox> In the end it’ll all be worth it because of the fact
<Fox> that I will bring your world crushing down upon you 10 times harder.
<Fox> Smoke and mirrors people.
<Fox> Smoke and mirrors.
<nachash> Keep in mind that even little shit you give up can rape you.
<nachash> Rough age, time zone, etc.
<Fox> IE:
<nachash> All of these things can and will be used by a master doxer to nail your ass to a wall.
<Fox> College sucks. My professor is a dick.
<nachash> It may not happen 5 minutes after you spill it.
<Fox> IE:
<nachash> But it will be noted, probably thrown in a textfile dossier on you
<nachash> And used with other pieces of info later on
<Fox> Dude this is fucking retarded. Everyone today is as the game against Rutgers. I’m stcuk here on IRC
<Fox> BANG
<nachash> Any doxer worth their salt is going to gather all the info they can on you
<Fox> These two statements
<Fox> innocuous right?
<nachash> And use it to weed out people with the same name as you, when they get that far.
<Fox> who here
<darkspline> Fox, nope
<darkspline> you, there
<Fox> has written something like that in their IRC career
<torify> during old gaming times on quakenet with friends sure
<nachash> Even comments about the weather can dick you over
<Circumvent> even so, with all that info, rough age, city, goes to college, that cant be a dox can it? not complete?
<torify> but i had no reason to hide my tracks back then 
<Fox> Circumvent
<nachash> Circumvent, not quite
<Fox> Alright
<nachash> But someone who knows what to do WILL keep that info
<Fox> well let me get a little specifc here
<Fox> every dox is different
<Fox> but lets take the case
<Fox> of the college kid right?
<nachash> And WILL use it when they get real info, to weed out the good from the bad.
<Fox> ESPN.com
<Fox> Rutgers game against –U
<Fox> So we now know target goes to –U
<Fox> Now lets say we use the girl ploy to get an IP
<Fox> via fake-cam with a strip tease and log off trick
<Fox> then SMS via google voice to stall the user right
<Fox> So at this point we have the IP of computer used, plus Cell phone potentially if they’re dumb
<nachash> Or SMS via prepaid.
<Circumvent> and a pic
<nachash> Boost and tracfone let you get phones with any area code you want
<Circumvent> u got a pic from cam too
<Fox> so then at that point we fake up some apache logs,
<nachash> Pics can be ran through shit like tineye
<Fox> call up the schools sys-admin
<nachash> And eventually, google is going to launch its tineye killer
<Fox> and say we need to know who was where at that time
<Fox> Usually those sys admins are fairly competent
<Fox> and will give you info on that particular user
<Fox> hell if you’re good you can sometimes get him to give you prior history on the Subject
<Circumvent> sorry im a bit lost there
<Fox> then from there we leverage other parts of the school to get dorm, et cetera.
<nachash> Sysadmin types share a certain instinctive kinship
<Fox> Lost where
<nachash> So getting prior history info may be easier than it sounds.
<Circumvent> the apache logs are created with the ip of the victum, showing that they have been doing something bad? then sysadmins give out info?
<nachash> If the college sysadmin thinks you’re “one of us,” you may get a lot of info off the cuff that you wouldn’t normally get.

<nachash> Yeah
<nachash> You just make up some logs
<nachash> Make them look legit
<Circumvent> i see i see
<nachash> Maybe do something to a box you own
<nachash> Then drop in the mark’s IP in place of yours
<nachash> Bam, convincing logs
<nachash> Also, in the case of apartment complexes, you can call the main office and verify residency
<nachash> A lot of places won’t even ask you a bunch of questions.
<Circumvent> this is dependent on a successful traceroute?
<nachash> You may have to fax them something.
<nachash> In which case, shit can get tricky
* Fox gives channel operator status to nachash
<nachash> Another old trick is getting info from PO Boxes.
<nachash> You’re NOT supposed to be able to get that.
<torify> PO?
<nachash> But I know plenty of people who have called up the post office, and been like, “I’m trying to deliver frozen meat, and they gave a PO Box. Where can I send it?”
* Fenrisz (xblackflag@5B158039.C0611936.6594496F.IP) has joined #school4lulz
<nachash> Post Office Box
<darkspline> torify, post office
<torify> kk
<nachash> They usually buck you
<Circumvent> yeah, where can i send it is perfect
<darkspline> nachash, i got PO so now u have my attention!!
<nachash> But if you threaten to dump a 50 lbs box of frozen meat inside their post office and walk away, they usually shit an address.
<darkspline> nachash, that sounds heavy though
<JohmasTefferson> brilliant
<nachash> It is.
<nachash> But any real doxer is going to do this shit
<nachash> This is why you don’t re-use usernames.
<nachash> You don’t give away a lot of personal info.
<darkspline> i’d rather send a certified letter and see how far they want to help confirm delivery
<nachash> That can be traced back
<nachash> Look at any piece of letter mail you get.
<darkspline> nachash, to find a PO owner
<nachash> See that orange-red shit near the stamp?
<darkspline> delivery is not my issue
<nachash> They have a scanner that tells where that came from
<nachash> If it’s a certified letter
<darkspline> nachash, i got my own methods for delivery
<nachash> They just put a piece of paper in the box
<nachash> And make them go to the counter and sign for it
<nachash> If you’ve got some other trickery, please, enlighten. This is what this channel is for
<darkspline> if say you doctor a legal doc to a PO box…
<Fox> Nachash
<Fox> or someone
<Fox> tweet me a log of this
<nachash> I don’t do twitter.
<Fox> I have to go to the store and shit
<Fox> cool?
<Fox> nachash
<nachash> Want me to put it on lolhackers?
<Fox> then put it in topic
<darkspline> Fox, be cool brother
<nachash> I’ve got axx still
<Fox> YES ON LOLHACKERS
<Fox> 
<nachash> Consider it done
<Fox> k
<Fox> bai guy
<Fox> z
<eni> i got ya fox
<Fox> Night gents
<JohmasTefferson> nitefox
* Fox has quit (Quit: Textual IRC Client: http://www.textualapp.com/)
<nachash> darkspline: They still put a piece of paper in the box, saying to go to the counter.
<darkspline> l8r bro
<Circumvent> cya
<nachash> And you’re back where you started.
<nachash> It’s best to social the post office
<nachash> Let’s discuss another trick
<nachash> Socialing for unlisted numbers.
<nachash> You have a number
<nachash> But want a billing address.
<darkspline> nachash, im just thinking how you can force them to release more info about a PO ident
<nachash> What’s an aspiring doxer to do?
<nachash> Why, you call them up, of course.
<nachash> I’ve seen this done.
<nachash> Though never did it myself
<nachash> I heard it on speaker one night
<nachash> You call your mark up
<nachash> And be like, “Yes, I’m so and so from Atlantic Bell. I’m calling to verify some time and charges to Boston.”
<nachash> They freak the fuck out every time.
<nachash> “Ok, well give me your info so I can verify who you are, and I’ll clean these charges cleaned right up.”
<nachash> The idea is to pose as someone with some authority.
<nachash> And scare the piss out of them.
<nachash> Note that it wasn’t really Atlantic Bell. The real company was called Bell Atlantic, and hasn’t existed for a while
<nachash> But that’s ok.
<nachash> You want something that sounds close, but not quite.
<JohmasTefferson> why not quite?
<nachash> The theory is that if you ever get v&, you weren’t posing as someone from a real phone company, so the charges against you will be fewer
<Circumvent> why not straight up impersonate?
<JohmasTefferson> wouldn’t you want to be as authentic as possible?
<Circumvent> i see
<nachash> That’s your risk to take, if you want to go that far.
<nachash> An easy one is to claim to be from United Package Service.
<nachash> The real company is United Parcel Service
<nachash> Anyway, this is going too far into socialing bitches.
<nachash> Let’s focus on sites for a bit
<nachash> I think you guys have the idea.
<nachash> You get all the info you can, from googling, talking up your mark, etc.
<nachash> Every time you get a new piece of info, you want to search with it on a variety of sites.
<nachash> pipl.com is a good start.
<nachash> They let you search usernames and e-mail addresses.
<nachash> knowem.com and checkusername.com are also handy some times.
<JohmasTefferson> what’s the best way to organize the data
<JohmasTefferson> i assume there will be redundancies
<nachash> I prefer just dumping it in textfiles.
<nachash> With links to sources at the bottom.
<nachash> Let me pull up some work I did.
<nachash> http://pastebin.com/4jvd02As
<nachash> Some of those people didn’t have personal websites or anything
<nachash> the ones who did, got their links dumped
<nachash> That’s roughly how I like to organize things.
<nachash> You may have a more logical approach to it.
<nachash> I started with a link to an old wikipedia article on archive.org
<nachash> And got all that info from a list of names.
<nachash> No contact, though.
<nachash> Check every scrap of data you get in as many ways as you can.
<nachash> http://encyclopediadramatica.ch/Dox#Stalker.27s_Resources
<nachash> That’s a good list of sites to grind info through.
<nachash> Some of them are shit, though.
<nachash> Zabasearch, for example.
<nachash> Too much noise.
<Fenrisz> linked in thoughts
<nachash> LinkedIn is great for finding info
<nachash> Especially on professionals
<nachash> (Think whitehats)
<nachash> Or any type of business person
<nachash> They put their resume, colleges, everything down
<nachash> The guy who ran the DoxInYourMom twitter account (May it rest in peace) turned me on to veromi.com
<nachash> It looks like its paid searches would be a waste of money
<nachash> Even at $15 for an unlimited 24 hour subscription
<nachash> But its real power is in finding the names of family members.
<nachash> With some people, you have to cast a wide net.
<nachash> Look at the family, in order to find them
<nachash> Hell, if they fucked up badly enough, include their family in the doxing.
<nachash> This is especially useful if you stalk via facebook/myspace/etc
<nachash> In the good old days, it was nothing to go to someone’s myspace, click around on their friends, and find where they had posted their cellphone number for all to see.
<eax> +o
* nachash gives channel operator status to eax
<nachash> I’ve seen you with ops before
<nachash> So I know I didn’t just fuck up
<nachash> Does anyone have any questions?
<curi0us> veromi is down btw
<curi0us> that was pretty thorough tho
<curi0us> i just need targets to practice on now
<nachash> There’s a lot more I could get into.
<curi0us> im listening
<nachash> I’ve been working on a guide that will make a lot of people shit bricks
<nachash> But I don’t know how much fox wants to hold back for the advanced classes.
<nachash> If you want to play around, just go to that ED link I gave, and start messing with those sites.
<curi0us> wanna talk about SE wit ISP or phone companies?
<Circumvent> how does one enrol
<nachash> Circumvent, I don’t know
<curi0us> email em
<nachash> curi0us, that’s one subject I’d have to hand off to someone else.
<JohmasTefferson> there was an email address posted days ago
<JohmasTefferson> I missed it though :/
<curi0us> i can get it for u
<curi0us> one sec
<Circumvent> tyvm
<curi0us> school4lulz@hushmail.com
<Circumvent> ty
<nachash> Ok, guys.
<nachash> I’m going to run.
<curi0us> make sure to add your SS number and any current CC numbers just to verify
<curi0us> 
<eni> thanks nachash
<curi0us> thanks man
<nachash> I guess for the sake of the logs, class is over.
