<phed> me please
<tzaki> might aswell throw me a +v
* xoxo gives voice to phed
* Fox sets mode +m #school4lulz
<Fox> Alright, just note anyone with +v
<Fox> you say dumb shit, get kicked.
<Fox> So todays topic is fraud.
<Fox> Things on the internet cost money.
* Condor has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
<Fox> Things on the internet that we want to buy, for bad reasons we obviously don't want attached to our name.
<xoxo> because if they do get attached to our name; we can get tracked
<Fox> Right now if paypal knew all the accounts that were attached to me, I'd probably owe them in excess of 30-40k.
<Fox> Now I'm going to cover how to pay, and how to get paid.
<Fox> Obviously paying isn't as complicated as getting paid.
* Fox gives voice to tzaki
<Fox> Anyways
<Fox> Paypal is obviously a good choice, as are any form of credit card numbers.
<Fox> Paypal is a great opportunity for you to use some of those docs that we covered in the prior session.
<Fox> Registering a paypal, should preferrably be done with a United States IP address, either VPN'd or Proxied.
<xoxo> Fox: even if you're residing outside the US? Why?
<Fox> Ensure that you have a clean browsing session, by private mode in chrome, ff, or IE is a good place to start.
<Chloe`> why is that, legislation?
<Fox> xoxo US paypals have the least amount of 'tie ups'
<xoxo> xoxo: roger that
<Fox> EU, IN, and AS paypals have a much higher fraud/regular applicant rate due to eastern european crime
<Fox> so it's best to just try and look like john q public for as long as you possibly can.
<Fox> Anyways, the preferred method to create a paypal
<Fox> imo, is a fresh gmail matching the name of your alias
<Fox> valid home address for someone, doesn't matter who
<Fox> vanilla visa (prepaid visa card or refillable card with 0 ties to your information)
<ElEzio> Fox, gmails now require a sms or phone call for verification
<xoxo> ElEzio: no, it doesn't. that is just far pass recovery.
<Fox> ElEzio not always. Only if multiple accounts are created from the same information.
<ElEzio> oh ok
<xoxo> ElEzio: for*
<Fox> anyways
<xoxo> Fox: any EU alternatives for vanilla visa?
<Chloe`> $500 / month for paypal new accounts
<Fox> Any free email provider will do
<Fox> xoxo not positive.
<Fox> Chloe` correct, but wrong
<Fox> 500 withdrawl limit.
<Fox> 500 sending limit is without CC
<Fox> so now that we've got a CC we're in step 1 verification
<Fox> To completely unlimit the account we need a bank.
<Chloe`> that is if I want to convert it to hardware, or launder it with eBay, there's a possibility.
<Fox> So, we're gonna hop on over to Etrade
<Chloe`> even above that limit
<Fox> Etrade is a brokerage firm that paypal recognizes instantly.
<Fox> So whilst creating an account with a 'real' ssn (doesn't matter if it's some poor schlep from google)
<Fox> You will have mild verification process that usually can be solved with an in depth doc dossier.
<Chloe`> (ssn = social security number, non-us guys)
<Fox> If not, find one and reuse the fuck out of it
<Fox> Anyways, once the application is completed you have an account number.
<Fox> You'd go back to paypal and enter the bank information as 
<Fox> Etrade Bank routing (google it?) and account number
<Fox> this will ask you to verify by deposit, or immediate with user and pass
<Fox> put in user pass from etrade
<Fox> bang, immediately verified paypal
* garrett gives voice to tminus
<Fox> Now, we move along from here into funding and purchases
<phed> so just by using a ssn from google we can get a etrade account?
<Fox> Yes, but you should most likely use the account within 30 minutes 
<phed> do we need anything else for it, a real address?
<Fox> fraud will kill those accounts
<phed> and link that to the prepaid vias?
<Fox> phed as long as the address validates with Etrades API as something valid you're fine
<Fox> So no 123-fuck street
<phed> yeah cool
<Fox> If you have a refillable visa, you can throw up the digits from that
<Fox> and withdraw
<Fox> Also Chloe` for the EU I think you all can use payoneer 
<Fox> but I'm not positive. Someone will have to verifiy
<Chloe`> (hint: transcash, in Europe)
<Fox> Anyways, moving down the line
<Fox> Some pro-tips with paypal.
<Chloe`> transcash is a prepaid Visa pair
<Chloe`> gotta check how it works
<Fox> Don't switch money out immediately
<Fox> Don't get a deposit, and immediately empty the whole thing
<Fox> Paypal gets this as money laundering
<Fox> and will shut your shit down so fast your head will spin
<Fox> wait a little while then pull out 3/4 and spend the rest,
<Fox> or pull it out in a day or so
<Fox> think like you're a REAL user, and act as such
<Fox> Most of paypals freezes are based upon predetermined actions and time 'if' statements
<Fox> Also if your shit is frozen, 
<Fox> Try calling them, usually they're pretty easy to social engineer.
<Fox> But if you have an ID lock on the account, then unless you're a forger or know one, you're pretty well fucked.
<Fox> ID Lock = Paypal hold on the account pending visual identification of the subject.
<Fox> Anyways, a lot of the things you can get with paypal are conversion services that can convert into different digital currencies.
<Fox> The two with the most anonymity and value I would say would be Liberty Reserve and BitCoin.
<Chloe`> like, credit a RandomService account and spend this virtual, deregulated money?
<Fox> http://www.libertyreserve.com/
<Fox> and someone get the bitcoin link
<garrett> i prefer LR over just about anything
<Chloe`> bitcoin.org
<Fox> Anyways Liberty Reserve is a lovely LOVELY way to get paid
<Fox> Liberty Reserve and BitCoin are both non-reversible forms of currency
<Fox> where as paypal is susceptible to shady chargeback procedures from a sellers behalf
<Fox> So for purchasing VPS, VPN's, Dedis, domains for things that are going to be hot
<Fox> Obviously paypal and un-ID-linked prepaids are going to be your way to go
<Fox> And garrett is going to talk about LR for a few min.
<garrett> herp
<Chloe`> workflow?
<garrett> Smoke breaks yo
<Fox> I'm grabbing a cigarette.
<Fox> lol
<garrett> LR is secure out of the box, all you really need is an email. 
<garrett> Your username is randomly assigned to you, as well as your passwords, key, and master key
<garrett> I'd suggest storing that info somewhere not on your machine.
<garrett> LR is IP locked, so if you're going to be moving around, make sure you remember the pass to the email you used
<garrett> Hrm
<Chloe`> they'll ask for confirmation when connecting from elsewhere?
<garrett> Yes, they will send you an email to confirm
<garrett> Also, LR takes their fee from INCOMING cash
<garrett> IE: I send Fox 1000USD, he receives 950USD
<garrett> Other than that, uh
<garrett> Payments from LR to LR are instantaneous
<garrett> And LR is easily cashed out via exchange service
<garrett> ebuygold.net does LR to WU within 24 hours
<garrett> did i miss anything?
<xoxo> garrett: ebuygold.net doesn't work
<garrett> wat
<Chloe`> .com
<Chloe`> maybe?
<garrett> derp
<garrett> yes
<garrett> .com
<Fox> K
<garrett> sorry
<xoxo> garrett: got that
<Fox> Sweet
<ElEzio> any others like it ?
<xoxo> garrett: what is WU btw?
<garrett> Ah
<garrett> Western Union
<Fox> Western Union.
<Fox> The holy grail of C'note pimping.
<ElEzio> word
<garrett> :P
<Fox> garrett should I teach them about mules?
<xoxo> garrett: Fox: WU asks for ID card, doesn't it?
<phed> yes please fox
<garrett> if you want to get into it, sure
<Fox> Kay, so mules are unsuspecting folk
<garrett> xoxo: you can do secret questions under a certain amt
<Fox> Both of those places have cards as well
<Fox> Prepaids
<Fox> So money = goes on card
<Fox> Also certain places will do SWIFT transfers, amongst a lot of other types
<Fox> so it's really what you wanna do
<Fox> But anyways,
<Fox> Mules are people that you get to cash money for you that don't know who you are.
<Fox> There are literally 10,000 ways to get mules
<Fox> but my personal favorite
<Fox> is meet someone
<Fox> give them an entirely fake name.
<Fox> Friend em up a bit
<Fox> then ask them to pick up the loot as you got mugged and don't have an ID
<Fox> it's to pay your rent, et cetera
<Fox> then when you meet them, slip em off a hundo, and never talk to them again
<Fox> So if the drop is hot
<Fox> and they picked up frauded money, or money that someone is looking for
<Fox> they are off looking for Dick
<Fox> when you're Harry.
<Fox> You follow?
<xoxo> Fox: that looks kinda brilliaaaaant!
<Fox> So just be smart.
<Chloe`> lotsa social in that.
<garrett> if you cannot social
<garrett> you will never take money from online
<garrett> to your hand
<garrett> ever
<Fox> We may get into a side-step of socialling
<Fox> but not right now.
<Fox> Anyways, monetization
<xoxo> garrett: Fox: ooh; that I can do :p
<Fox> the good stuff.
* aganaktismenoi_sto_irc (~giannhs@LulzCo-669A9C40.home.otenet.gr) has joined #school4lulz
<ElEzio> is it not possible to WU the money to another country ? and pick it up there ?
<Fox> Monetization is how are you going to take these bomb ass skills you're learning here in #school4lulz and apply it to make loot
<Fox> ElEzio it is indeed.
<Fox> If you are a lucky bastard in Latvia or some shit
<Fox> Don't give a fuck.
<Fox> Get loot. 
<Fox> Anyways
<Fox> Monetization is how are you going to take these bomb ass skills you're learning here in #school4lulz and apply it to make loot
<Fox> So your options are pretty much as Follows
<xoxo> Fox: Belgium, kinda hot? Or Latvia-style?
<Fox> Belgium is a cooperating country.
<Chloe`> benelux, europe, danger.
<Fox> I'd recommend some discretion.
<Fox> Options for Money = 
<Fox> Doxing for money
<Fox> Hacking for Money
<Fox> selling email lists
<Fox> selling user-dbs
<Fox> selling compromised servers
<Fox> and my personal favorite, which bought me my first car as a kid...
<Fox> DDOS for money.
<Fox> There's other shit but its irrelevant right now
<xoxo> DDos for money? So you had a botnet i suppose?
<Fox> Anyways I'll briefly cover each
<tminus> What do you think about spamming
<Fox> I pissed packets of excellence every morning
<Chloe`> like, typically, i'm sysadmin and root on some hosting, silently stream the DB to some remote location, datamine it and sell the ore?
<Fox> tminus Spamming is also another viable solution, thank you
<Fox> Chloe` exactly.
<Fox> I did that a few times myself.
<Chloe`> rates ?
<Fox> i'll get to that with the data

<Chloe`> kthx
<Fox> now someone put in something about selling exploits.
<Fox> Going to clarify.
<Fox> WE DO NOT SELL EXPLOITS TO COMPANYS FOR PROFIT.
<Fox> Period.
<Fox> Thats whitehat shit.
<Fox> We don't do whitehat.
<Fox> I don't give a fuck how broke you are, there is a RBN affiliate or someone in eastern europe willing to pay you more, and pay you more often.
<Fox> So deal within the community on that shit
<Fox> Anyways doxing and hacking for money is pretty self explanitory
* xoxo gives voice to darkspline
<Fox> So lets get down to emails and user DB's
<tzaki> is the notes for the sqli tutorial anywhere?
<Fox> User db's are valuable when cracked from MD5 to plaintext as you are able to sell these to a lot of people
<Fox> Tzaki, stfu. ask that later.
<xoxo> (off-topic: any good md5-cracker)
<tzaki> kk
<Fox> Anyways
<Fox> When user db's are converted to plaintext, you are able to do two things
* xoxo gives voice to zach
<Fox> split it into two pieces, one being an email list
<Fox> the other being the user:pass combo
<zach> xoxo: hashcat
<Fox> So divvy that up and start making yourself some friends
<Fox> Spammers, and frauders love this kind of shit
<Fox> I've sold email DB's in the $5,000 USD range, and user db's in the $2,000 range.
* qqqq (~User@LulzCo-72899B27.appliedops.net) has joined #school4lulz
<Fox> This is good money, for good data.
<darkspline> wow!
<Fox> Obviously, if you crack iluvpuppies.blogspot.com
<Chloe`> rate per row?
<Fox> No one gives a flying fuck.
<xoxo> Fox: everything of this should be done with VPN right? (or Tor)
<xoxo> #justtipsfornewbies
<Fox> Chloe` all dependent upon the mark
<Fox> xoxo yes
<Fox> Anyways, moving down the line to...
<Fox> DDOS FOR MONEY.
<Fox> :)
<xoxo> (your first carà
<xoxo> (your first car)*
<Fox> So DDOS is Distributed Denial Of Service.
<Fox> AND NOT LOIC YOU FUCKING NOOB ASS FAGGOTS.
<zach> and RAID is backup
<zach> :D
<Fox> Fucking hate loic....
<Fox> Fucking hate loic....
* Fox has kicked zach from #school4lulz (Shut the fuck up.)
* zach (~zach@LulzCo-C17AE2F0.wks.liquidweb.com) has joined #school4lulz
<Fox> Anyways.
<Fox> Anyone ready to pay you to DDOS is either A. In a vendetta, or B. too retarded to throw around packets themselves.
<Fox> Charge them accordingly.
<Fox> Sec. gents.
<Fox> Anyways
* xoxo gives voice to zach
<Fox> Pisser I need someone to handle things for a few seconds
<Fox> I got a client calling
<xoxo> Whatcha got bro?
<Chloe`> ok typically it will be a good investment to write automated datamining tools. best way to retrieve the data? i'd use a base64-ed GET
<Chloe`> (no file, no trace, no scp, just a random domain)

<Fox> <3 keep going Chloe` 
<Fox> Gonna be like 10 min
<zach> Fox: anything I can do for you today?
<Chloe`> Once you can do SQL injection I assume it is easy to fetch data you want. Typically try a table named prefix_customers or prefix_users, with sing. variant. Use of EXPLAIN sql command might be cool if you can manage it 
<Chloe`> as I am a shell owner, I'll usually use streamlined bash that will perform a GET request. One single line in history, easy to grep out, usually won't be caught by a firewall (if you're root you're supposed to know anyway)
<Chloe`> if you can just inject a php file, for the sake of it, don't send anything to a domain you own. rather exploit another one, to make it harder to track you. or buy one with the great techniques Fox teaches you, with a fake identity, have it point to a random VPS and parse its logs. Whatever, these are disposable data IMO. I'm consdering doing such things for demonstration purposes
<eax> note: if you sqli a 5.xx sql server you can use information_schema to pull up tables and columns and you won't need to guess
<Chloe`> yup eax, that's a good point indeed :) on some hosts (my former employer's for example), information_schema can't be accessed with plain accounts
<Chloe`> dunno why. probably some configuration trick
<zach> Chloe`: http://www.wildcardsecurity.com/security101/index.php?title=SQL_injection#Blind_injection
<Chloe`> thx
<Chloe`> another idea: target common platforms, like ecommerce websites
<Chloe`> they usually have lots of flaws (I'm an ecommerce dev, I know this), and are not always often updated for compatibility purposes
<ElEzio> any word on porn sites ?
<Chloe`> if you write stuff for oscommerce, or prestashop, and you can secure an access to lots of them, you'll get plenty of good data
<Chloe`> not all of them use salting, afaik
<Fox> I'll get in dumping CC's here shortly
* Fox sets mode -m #school4lulz
<darkspline> mostly md5 still from what I'm seeing Chloe` 
<Chloe`> so, rainbow tabling might be an option, another being to slightly alter the code to send the unencrypted data (hee haa, base64 GET) to a random place
* DaveH (~DaveH@LulzCo-7A24A8D1.dsl.eclipse.net.uk) has joined #school4lulz
<Fox> Someone make a pastebin of all this data please
<Chloe`> darkspline: salty md5 though sometimes
<darkspline> Chloe`, really? any tricks w/salty md5 seas?

<Chloe`> darkspline: bruteforce.
<darkspline> yahh
<darkspline> Chloe`, gotta get my gpu farm up for that
<Chloe`> get info on cryptoanalysis.
<darkspline> Chloe`, i've looked into it but not may short cuts that i c
* ex (~ex@DB4CEAE5.76708DC0.B7449AAF.IP) has joined #school4lulz
<Chloe`> an interesting project, since salts are not always that rich (some use a 2 hexchars salt, making it only 255 times slower) would be to rainbow table sal ranges
<Chloe`> salt ranges
<darkspline> thats true
<Chloe`> a trick i use quite often if I come to hashing is salting with a hash, making it twofold hashing, harder to reverse
<darkspline> i like
<darkspline> i do something similar
<zone> class is over?
<Chloe`> it's not worth good money to spend time cracking such passwords, except if that's for breaking into some data you die wanting
<Chloe`> nay, Fox is getting a cig
<darkspline> i wanted to upgrade some stuff from sha1 to sha256 but i didn't have the origional data.  so I sha256(sha1val)
<Fox> suspended for a second while fox makes money
