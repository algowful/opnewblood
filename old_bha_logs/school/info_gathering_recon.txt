Info Gathering (by hatter)

[19:01] <~hatter> For our example today, we're going to use scorpion.canthack.us
[19:01] <~hatter> Everyone have nmap installed?
[19:01] <~hatter> if you don't have nmap installed, its available for windows and linux at http://nmap.org/ or http://insecure.org/
[19:01] <~hatter> If anyone has any installation troubles, PM someone.
[19:02] <~hatter> if you're on a public wifi,
[19:02] <~hatter> you'll want to do a fast scan, semi-loud, and just defeat the ratelimit for iptables based firewalls
[19:02] <~hatter> you'll want invasive version fingerprinting and operating system detection
[19:02] <~hatter> along with a traceroute that works

[19:02] <~hatter> everyone can go ahead and traceroute scorpion.canthack.us
[19:02] <@dot> my nmap isnt working
[19:02] <~hatter> or tracert
[19:03] <~hatter> dot: pm someone
[19:03] <@dot> lol
[19:03] <@dot> was joking sorry teach
[19:03] <~hatter> anyway
[19:03] <~hatter> On windows its tracert
[19:03] <~hatter> tracert -d
[19:03] <~hatter> will give only the ips

15[19:04] * Fox sets mode: +v LulzSheep
[19:04] <~hatter> so the traceroute gets blocked
[19:05] <~hatter> you can bypass this with various tcp traceroute utilities, and I believe NMAP actually uses a tcp traceroute to an open port it finds from its port scan
[19:05] <~hatter> on gentoo's traceroute
[19:05] <~hatter> you can bypass this with a simple traceroute -T -p

[19:05] <+JohmasTefferson> question:
[19:05] <~hatter> for example:
[19:05] <~hatter> JohmasTefferson: shoot
[19:05] <~hatter> ask away
[19:06] <+JohmasTefferson> on this box, it traced everything with the default windows tracert
[19:06] <~hatter> ok
[19:06] <+JohmasTefferson> so does that mean it's leaving something out?
[19:06] <~hatter> So maybe there's a different routing path that it took
[19:06] <~hatter> that didn't get firewalled
[19:06] <~hatter> I'll look into it
[19:06] <~hatter> Thanks for the heads up.
[19:06] <+JohmasTefferson> I can tell you where I came from if you'd like to know.
[19:06] <~hatter> just pm me your ip
[19:06] <~hatter> the origin ip
[19:07] <~hatter> anyway
[19:07] <~hatter> when you traceroute with TCP 
[19:07] <~hatter> its different than a typical udp/icmp traceroute
[19:07] <~hatter> Like I said, nmap has this built in by default, I believe
[19:07] <~hatter> so
[19:07] <~Sav> still works by setting incrementing ttls, though?
[19:08] <~hatter> Sav: I believe so, with SYN/ERG kind of like a BGP request
[19:08] <~hatter> so, then,

[19:14] <~hatter> say a packet was hella fragmented
[19:14] <~hatter> Arsis: you on latest nmap?
[19:14] <+Arsis> I believe so yes
[19:15] <~hatter> Say that a packet was hella fragmented

[19:15] <~hatter> the ids on the outside wouldn't see that
[19:15] <~hatter> but after stateful packet inspection on the firewall
[19:15] <~hatter> which effectively reconstructs the packet for the attacker

[19:19] <~hatter> ^
[19:19] <~hatter> Anyway
[19:19] <~hatter> Here's why its incompetency
[19:19] <~Sav> Disabling ping is like changing SSH port.
[19:19] <+CMYK> ah I see.
[19:19] <+torify> okay thx phed adding --traceroute did the thing for me (sry 4 interrupting)
[19:19] <~hatter> there's a type of network layer attack
[19:19] <~hatter> called an ICMP redirect
[19:19] <~Sav> (It's like, hiding instead of hardening)
[19:19] <~hatter> it makes target hosts start sending BGP traffic to another BGP gateway
[19:19] <~hatter> By completely disabling ICMP 
[19:19] <~hatter> they are protecting themselves from that
[19:20] <~hatter> on the flipside, they're missing out on all the things that ICMP has to offer
[19:20] <~hatter> They should simply disable ICMP Type 8
[19:20] <~hatter> for inbound
[19:20] <~hatter> the end
[19:20] <+Spozm> Question: Should nmap scans/tracerouting be done behind proxycondoms/etc? Or is it not something that gets the target's attention?
[19:20] <~hatter> Well, that depends Spozm 
[19:21] <~hatter> As we learned in covering yo trax
[19:21] <@dot> Depends on the network you're scanning lol

[19:25] <~hatter> LulzSheep: that's not gonna show open ports
[19:25] <~hatter> LulzSheep: that's a tracert
[19:25] <+rabbit> can we identify the IDS/Firewall by looking to the IP ?
[19:25] <~Fox> lol
[19:25] <~hatter> that traces the border gateways and routers between you and the remote host
[19:26] <+Lemon> yes rabbit using nmap
[19:26] <~hatter> so you can see the way traffic is shaped
[19:26] <~hatter> there are other ways also
[19:26] <~hatter> Who wants to see how many ppl here are monitored by feds?
[19:26] <~hatter> lol
[19:26] <+Lemon> check me

[19:27] <~hatter> http://www.maxmind.com/app/locate_demo_ip
[19:27] <~hatter> rabbit: sometimes the IDS doesn't even have an IP\
[19:27] <~hatter> and is just on the SPAN port on the router
[19:27] <~hatter> n then crossovere'd to a private vlan
[19:27] <~hatter> on a firewall
[19:27] <+Lemon> 8081
[19:27] <~hatter> or to the server itself
[19:28] <+patriot> my question : just wanna know what do these stand for  nmap -sS -sV -O -F --defeat-rst-ratelimit -P0 scorpion.canthack.us
15[19:28] <+LulzSheep> http://ScrnSht.com/jxyenj this is what I've got
[19:28] <+torify> LulzSheep, add --traceroute
[19:28] <~hatter> -sS is a full syn scan -O gives operating system detection
[19:28] <~hatter> oh
[19:28] <~hatter> -A
[19:28] <~hatter> -A is also traceroute
[19:28] <~hatter> I believe
[19:29] <~hatter> anyway 
[19:29] <~hatter> -F means fast scan (top 100 ports)
15[19:29] <+LulzSheep> I'm using windows
[19:29] <~hatter> -sV is version detection
[19:29] <~hatter> -P0 means no ping
[19:29] <+torify> yes but don't u see the command line in your client lulzsheep
[19:29] <+patriot> thanks sir !
[19:29] <~hatter> --defeat-rst-ratelimit will defeat any ratelimits that cause a FIN_RST response in the remote firewall (typically iptables)
[19:29] <+torify> there's your command and it misses the --traceroute part, just put it before the url
[19:29] <+patriot> thanks a lot
15[19:30] * Fox sets mode: +v smeegle
[19:30] <+rabbit> I dunno how firewall works, can youo explain briefly what is ratelimit?
14[19:31] * prophet (proph3t@D72F3306.11F2790.C229B399.IP) Quit (Ping timeout)
[19:31] <~hatter> a ratelimit is where a firewall sees that you're trying to create a certain number of connections to a server in a specific amount of time
[19:31] <~hatter> If you go above this number (the ratelimit)
[19:31] <~hatter> The firewall will start denying your traffic
[19:31] <+smeegle> ratelimit limits the rate at which packets may enter from a single host
[19:31] <~hatter> --defeat-rst-ratelimit attempts to ignore/defeat this firewall option
[19:31] <~hatter> 18:32 <+smeegle> ratelimit limits the rate at which packets may enter from a single host
[19:31] <~hatter> Also that
[19:32] <~hatter> Kinda depends on which ratelimit we're talking
[19:32] <~hatter> could be packets, syn packets specifically, etc

[19:41] <~hatter> nikto has some interesting features, ids evasion, request mutation
[19:42] <~hatter> you can also write scripts and extensions for it
[19:42] <~hatter> Nikto is basically a web crawler with a CVE database
[19:42] <~hatter> as it discovers basic configuration issues or known vulnerabilities

[19:47] <~hatter> now if you use -e 9
[19:48] <~hatter> that's session splicing
[19:48] <~hatter> notice it doesn't work against scorpion
[19:48] <~hatter> this is because scorpion does not accept content-type chunked
[19:48] <~hatter> Scorpion is a relatively locked down machine that is to be used as a user sandbox for the advanced classes
[19:49] <~hatter> so if your nikto is not returning very much, that'd be why
[19:49] <~hatter> in any case, one common thing you will find on shared hosts is the enabled mod_userdir for apache
