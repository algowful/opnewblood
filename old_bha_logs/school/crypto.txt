StalluManu: Everyone here?
[17:38:38] ~Fox: nigga
[17:38:38] %eax: lolwat
[17:38:42] ~Fox: 6:13:37
[17:38:52] lolwat: it's 01:38 GMT
[17:38:56] lolwat: i'm in portugal, so...
[17:38:59] lolwat: time to sleep =(
[17:39:13] %eax: aww
[17:39:13] Dox: pst?
[17:39:24] lolwat: take 8 hours
[17:39:28] %LordKitsuna: 5:39
[17:39:30] lolwat: 01:39 AM i mean
[17:39:44] Dox: then you miss out :(
[17:40:00] lolwat: i read the logs... :)
[17:40:15] Dox: yeah I have had to aswell, was on a trip for a few days
[17:40:19] ~Fox: Well
[17:40:27] Fox sets mode +h StalluManu
[17:40:34] ~Fox: StalluManu is todays guezt speeker
[17:40:41] zone: yay
[17:40:46] ~Fox: Ask this nigga if he is ready to start
[17:40:56] %StalluManu: always read.
[17:40:58] Hellspawn: Scuse me Nigz, you ready?
[17:40:58] %StalluManu: *ready
[17:41:13] %StalluManu: so, we start early then?
[17:41:17] %eax: stallu is a cool cat
[17:41:17] Anorov: what's this lesson on?
[17:41:18] zone: NAO
[17:41:21] zone: +m
[17:41:25] Hellspawn: Cryptography and detection.
[17:41:25] Fox sets mode +m
[17:41:36] ~Fox: dont be askin me for v and shit
[17:41:40] %StalluManu: LISTEN UP FAGS. You've learned shit that can get you v&.
[17:42:17] %StalluManu: Today's goal is to educate you pieces of grabbastic amphibian shit on how to prevent other people from doxing you, and how to prevent going to jail.
[17:42:29] %StalluManu: First of all...
[17:42:37] -CTCP- VERSION from StalluManu
[17:42:45] %StalluManu: Wow....
[17:42:49] %StalluManu: Some of you even use MIRC.
[17:42:52] whiteh8 (~whiteh8@457983EB.FF3F5C6F.ED3D20FE.IP) joined the channel.
[17:43:03] %StalluManu: You see, to prevent people from doxing you.. you first have to have a secure box yourself.
[17:43:05] Fox sets mode +h whiteh8
[17:43:07] %StalluManu: so STOP RUNNING SHIT SOFTWARE.
[17:43:15] %StalluManu: Mirc is a fine example of it.
[17:43:19] %LordKitsuna: xchat= shit?
[17:43:29] %whiteh8: thx fox
[17:43:38] %StalluManu: xchat=shit.
[17:43:52] %StalluManu: prefer anything with SIMPLE CODE. commandline > GUI.
[17:43:58] %StalluManu: Less code is LESS TO EXPLOIT.
[17:44:10] %whiteh8: #hipsterhackers
[17:44:13] %StalluManu: More urgently: get the fuck rid off of mirc.
[17:44:22] %StalluManu: There's two exploits in the wild that i know of, one that i have.
[17:44:32] %eax: kthnx
[17:44:54] %StalluManu: now that you all know that you're running retarded software, i recommend you install linux.
[17:45:18] %StalluManu: 'cause i will not try to cover patching up a windows box, and windows specific shit.
[17:45:57] %StalluManu: So, let's say you got your retarded ass into trouble, and got hacked. Sorry, but you're fucked. This talk is not going to help you.
[17:46:29] %StalluManu: However if you seek to prevent the feds that will undoubtedly raid your home one day from reading your logs, stay the fuck in here.
[17:46:45] %StalluManu: The basics: get truecrypt.
[17:47:03] %StalluManu: On linux you will need to modify your initrd to encrypt a full partition, check the arch or gentoo wiki on how to do that.
[17:47:10] %StalluManu: CHOOSE A STRONG FUCKING PASSWORD.
[17:47:23] %StalluManu: if you dont, why the fuck bother?
[17:47:27] %whiteh8: (unmount it every night)
[17:47:44] darkmatter (~darkmatte@LulzCo-9808FA01.cpe.metrocast.net) joined the channel.
[17:47:45] %StalluManu: whiteh8: good point.
[17:47:49] %whiteh8: before bed
[17:47:51] %StalluManu: Feds will probably raid your house at night.
[17:47:59] %whiteh8: 4-6am
[17:48:06] %StalluManu: So if you want to prevent them from recovering shit, shut that shit down.
[17:48:06] lululu (cackledack@BE33FEAC.7EEC6A54.934538AF.IP) joined the channel.
[17:48:24] %StalluManu: Now, here's the idea for REALLY FUCKING PARANOID PEOPLE.
[17:48:42] %StalluManu: #1: Compile gentoo and make a /boot and / partition on a microsd card.
[17:48:50] %StalluManu: add truecrypt to your initrd.
[17:49:06] daniel (~daniel@is.cool) joined the channel.
[17:49:10] %StalluManu: add various checksums of files in your initrd to the truecrypted root partition: so you know when you're compromised.
[17:49:28] %StalluManu: from now on you run your OS from that microsd card.
[17:49:41] %StalluManu: keep ONE backup, burried somewhere.
[17:50:00] %StalluManu: now. wat do if feds raid your house and the comp is still on?
[17:50:06] %StalluManu: you boot from that card remember?
[17:50:08] %StalluManu: pull the card.
[17:50:10] %StalluManu: break it in half.
[17:50:10] %StalluManu: eat it.
[17:50:32] %StalluManu: good luck to the fed trying to recover from a broken encrypted piece of flash memory.
[17:50:50] %whiteh8: that's awesome
[17:50:55] %StalluManu: Note: we're covering hardware shit now.
[17:51:03] DaveH (~DaveH@LulzCo-7A24A8D1.dsl.eclipse.net.uk) left IRC. (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[17:51:09] %StalluManu: BUT IHAZ A LAPTOP/I GO IN PUBLIC/ I WONT DARE TO DO THAT WITH A GUN POINTED TO MY HEAD.
[17:51:12] %StalluManu: good point faggot.
[17:51:20] %StalluManu: The way they recover the key when your box is on is a cold boot attack.
[17:51:36] %StalluManu: If you use liquid nitrogen to freeze the RAM banks, they retain their data pretty well.
[17:51:42] %StalluManu: That data contains the decryption key of your volume.
[17:51:45] %StalluManu: if they do this, you are fucked.
[17:51:47] %StalluManu: But no worries.
[17:52:03] %StalluManu: You can avoid this using a really goddamn simple technique.
[17:52:21] %StalluManu: #1: Epoxy the bios battery in place WITH A FUCKTON OF GLUE (dont cover the pins that connect it).
[17:52:28] %StalluManu: #2: EPOXY YOUR RAM IN PLACE
[17:52:32] %StalluManu: #3: set a boot password.
[17:52:40] %StalluManu: voilla, they cant boot, they cant take the ram, they cant extract data.
[17:53:01] %StalluManu: so even if they raid you, get the card whole, the computer online, they cant do shit.
[17:53:22] ~Fox: Thermite is for the movies faggots.
[17:54:00] %StalluManu: Now, after you do this you wont be able to reset your bios, so you better not fuck it up/forget the password, or your box is bricked.
[17:54:13] %StalluManu: The key here is that a COLD BOOT ATTACK CAN WORK FOR UP TO 45 MINUTES AFTER SHUTDOWN.
[17:54:15] %StalluManu: REMEMBER THAT FAGS.
[17:54:16] %StalluManu: 45 MINUTES.
[17:54:29] %StalluManu: YOU HAVE TO DETER THE FEDS FROM BOOTING INTO YOUR SYSTEM FOR 45 MINUTES.
[17:54:50] %StalluManu: THAT BETTER BE A FUCKTON OF GLUE ATTACHING IMPORTANT PIECES OF YOUR MOBO TO YOUR BATTERY.
[17:54:58] %StalluManu: oh, and dont cover chips, they get hot, kthnx?
[17:55:19] %StalluManu: Now that we've got the physical part of cold booting taken care off, there's more common shit.
[17:55:24] %StalluManu: HARDWARE KEYLOGGERS.
[17:55:30] %StalluManu: CHECK THE BACK OF YOUR PC EVERY TIME YOU BOOT IT.

[17:56:22] %whiteh8: if you're going across the border, MAIL your laptop to your hotel
[17:56:38] ~Fox: *
[17:56:39] %StalluManu: laptop void if seal is broken.

[17:57:32] %StalluManu: BUY ONE.

[17:57:39] ~Fox: +1
[17:57:42] %StalluManu: easy walk trough customs even if they check your fucking wallet.
[17:57:45] eax sets mode +v darkspline
[17:57:53] %StalluManu: everyone follow?
[17:58:00] %StalluManu: Because shit will get a lot more technical and hairy later on.
[17:58:02] %whiteh8: http://www.amazon.com/US-Mint-Quarter-Covert-Compartment/dp/B0036VJHXG
[17:58:25] %StalluManu: So: BOOT FROM AN ENCRYPTED MICROSD CARD. HAVE ONE BACKUP.
[17:58:48] %StalluManu: Recommended distro: gentoo, a huge fucking install in a squashfs image (See also: how to make a liveusb) takes only 2gb.
[17:58:50] eax sets mode +v Shidash
[17:58:58] %StalluManu: Now here's a few pointers before you go booting off of flass.
[17:59:00] %StalluManu: *flash.
[17:59:06] %StalluManu: FORMAT WITH EXT2. you do NOT want a journal.
[17:59:18] %StalluManu: mount with noatime nodiratime, you do NOT want excess writes.
[17:59:28] %StalluManu: After 10-100 writes per block, flash memory DIES.
[17:59:32] Fox sets mode +h t
[17:59:37] %StalluManu: so a 16gb sd card takes 160gb of writes, then it's DEAD.
[18:00:08] %StalluManu: you WILL run into this the first one or two months you use and tweak your distro.
[18:00:24] %StalluManu: Now that you've got this k-rad setup, you think that the government can't bruteforce your shit.
[18:00:28] %StalluManu: WRONG.
[18:00:38] %StalluManu: There's ps3 truecrypt bruteforcers (dictionary attack) out there.
[18:00:45] %StalluManu: yes for truecrypt volumes
[18:01:02] %StalluManu: the NSA can currently guess about 1.5m truecrypt keys a second, making a 8 characters password within their reach.
[18:01:13] %StalluManu: now, there's a solution to that.
[18:01:26] %StalluManu: But first more about what encryption does.
[18:01:28] %StalluManu: Encryption CAN ALWAYS BE CRACKED.
[18:01:29] %whiteh8: mine's over 30
[18:01:38] %StalluManu: mine's over 60 chars.
[18:01:43] %StalluManu: i got two passes btw.
[18:01:54] +Shidash: Mine is over 60
[18:02:01] %StalluManu: Now: what encryption does is BUY YOU TIME.
[18:02:28] %StalluManu: you are HOPING for the persecution limit (am i saying this right) of your crime to expire before the encryption is cracked.
[18:02:39] ~Fox: prosecution.
[18:02:52] @garrett: what
[18:02:57] @garrett: the statute of limitations?
[18:03:00] @garrett: cmon
[18:03:01] ~Fox: THANK YOU
[18:03:01] %StalluManu: yup.
[18:03:09] %StalluManu: I'
[18:03:09] %whiteh8: that's typically a few years
[18:03:12] @garrett: you're joking right?
[18:03:12] @garrett: like
[18:03:14] @garrett: you're implying
[18:03:15] ~Fox: Decade.
[18:03:16] @garrett: that the government
[18:03:17] %StalluManu: I'm not an Amerifag.
[18:03:18] @garrett: will waste
[18:03:21] @garrett: millions in resources
[18:03:25] @garrett: so they can crack your drive
[18:03:30] @garrett: so they can see you looking at furry porn
[18:03:32] @garrett: and you 600 bots
[18:03:34] %StalluManu: In the european union the statue of limitations is 18 years for computer crime.
[18:03:35] @garrett: be realistic.
[18:03:38] ~Fox: Lol
[18:03:40] ~Fox: Hold up
[18:03:46] ~Fox: let me lay down the law real quick
[18:04:02] ~Fox: Now, your level of 'hot-ness' is dependent upon what they got you for
[18:04:12] +Shidash: garrett: They have a limited budget. Waste enough time and money and they stop.
[18:04:17] ~Fox: They kick in your door for a simple unauthorized access of a DC box,
[18:04:25] ~Fox: You get maybe a few days worth of their time
[18:04:27] ~Fox: You hit a company

[18:04:54] @garrett: ok
[18:04:55] @garrett: so
[18:05:06] @garrett: in order for any electronic case to be viable in federal court
[18:05:07] %StalluManu: You are me: you get all their time.
[18:05:14] %whiteh8: honestly if you aren't playing around with money, they're not going to waste a lot of time on you
[18:05:15] @garrett: you have to cause X number of monetary damage

[18:06:12] %StalluManu: garett: Don't believe me? Ask Awinee lulz.
[18:06:15] ~Fox: @garrett respect your enemy :/

[18:06:18] +Shidash: If you are playing with their documents then they will still spend time on you.
[18:06:27] ~Fox: Ok we're getting into a debate here
[18:06:29] @garrett: Oh ofc
[18:06:37] ~Fox: So just to kill it
[18:06:38] %StalluManu: ok.
[18:06:40] %StalluManu: here's the deal.
[18:06:51] ~Fox: You fuck up, you best hope you made sure you handled business.
[18:06:52] ~Fox: Period.
[18:06:54] %StalluManu: you piss off someone important, show their incompetence. they will rape you.
[18:07:15] %StalluManu: Now, security is about buying TIME.
[18:07:26] %StalluManu: The amounth of TIME You buy varies depending on the STRENGTH of your encryption.
[18:07:33] %StalluManu: STRENGHT is not measured in bits of key.
[18:07:42] tzaki (~shinji@LulzCo-912C65A8.know.cable.virginmedia.com) joined the channel.

[18:08:51] %StalluManu: Ok, so now you've got a huge ass password, and a huge ass set of strong ciphers( google for them fag).
[18:08:58] %StalluManu: HOW THE FUCK DOES IT WERK?
[18:09:14] %StalluManu: Ok, your password is hashed, using a one-way function.
[18:09:33] %StalluManu: Think of a hash function as counting: 1 for a, 2 for b, and adding it. Just in a way that is cryptographically secure, and unlikely to generate collisions.
[18:09:43] garrett sets mode +v tminus
[18:09:47] %StalluManu: a hash COLLISION (a+a=b) means you can use a DIFFERENT pass to decrypt the data.
[18:09:52] %StalluManu: which is bad.
[18:10:06] %whiteh8: 2 strings evaluates to the same hash
[18:10:12] %StalluManu: collisions are dependent on the hash function, but mostly on the LENGTH Of the hash in bits.
[18:10:30] %StalluManu: weak algorithms: md5,sha1,md4,ntlm,lm
[18:10:43] +darkspline: what do you prefer?
[18:10:43] %StalluManu: strong algorithms:whirlpool,ripemd160,sha512
[18:10:46] +darkspline: k
[18:11:01] %StalluManu: Now, these hashes are important.
[18:11:05] %StalluManu: You see, they ARE not the password.
[18:11:09] %StalluManu: And there's no way to reverse them.
[18:11:14] %StalluManu: then how the fuck do you check if the password was correct?
[18:11:27] +darkspline: whirlpool(pass)
[18:11:37] %StalluManu: well, you run the password that's entered trough the hash function, compare the value, if they are the same, they are the same password.
[18:11:43] %StalluManu: (with a high likelihood)
[18:11:50] %StalluManu: (really fucking high likelihood)
[18:12:09] %StalluManu: hashes are bruteforcable because of the way you check them.
[18:12:14] %StalluManu: You have a hash function, and a hash.
[18:12:15] %whiteh8: StalluManu, on that same note, md5 file checksums will also collide, in case that wasn't clear to anyone

[18:12:36] %StalluManu: You run random passwords trough the function till you have a match, then you know the password.
[18:12:40] %StalluManu: This is how hash bruteforcing works.
[18:12:54] %StalluManu: (usually not a random password, but incremental, for the dumbasses under us)
[18:13:09] %StalluManu: Bruteforcing is REALLY FUCKING FAST if you design your function shittily.
[18:13:31] %StalluManu: You see, you can just compute hashes beforehand, and run a password against a table of them (actually chains of them, later more on RTS).
[18:13:50] %StalluManu: That makes it really fucking efficient to pwn your password! Fuck! we dont want that!
[18:13:58] %StalluManu: the solution: say whirlpool is your hash function
[18:14:04] %StalluManu: so whirlpool("ANUS")=some hash
[18:14:14] %StalluManu: you just do whirlpool(whirlpool("ANUS"))
[18:14:24] %StalluManu: and continue applying whirlpool till it's really fucking slow.
[18:14:27] %StalluManu: i prefer 20k passes.
[18:14:31] +darkspline: werd
[18:14:45] %StalluManu: now that it's really fucking slow, it takes really fucking long to make one guess.
[18:14:48] %StalluManu: that's what you want.

[18:15:48] %StalluManu: Now, you've got a fucking slow hash function.
[18:16:03] %StalluManu: You are still vulnerable to people that will just compute all keys and check your hash against a fucking table.
[18:16:06] %StalluManu: WAT DO?
[18:16:24] %StalluManu: so some fuckwit got a brilliant idea.
[18:16:31] %StalluManu: he added some random data he stored somewhere inside the hashing function
[18:16:34] %StalluManu: appended it to the password.
[18:16:35] %StalluManu: like so:
[18:16:43] %StalluManu: whirlpool("ANUS"+a;ldfkjas;ldkfjas;ldfjasd;lfkj)

[18:19:32] %StalluManu: This is the basis of cryptography.
[18:19:42] %StalluManu: Making shit difficult and slow to bruteforce.

[18:20:30] %StalluManu: Now we've got a good encryption algorithm, a good key scheme, but how the fuck do we generate a random salt.

[18:20:47] %StalluManu: computers are logical machines.
[18:20:52] %StalluManu: they DO NOT DO randomness.
[18:21:13] %StalluManu: Unless you have a geigercounter, a RF antenna collecting noise or something measuring the splitting of laser beams hooked up to your box that is.
[18:21:25] %StalluManu: Knowing that computers are not random however is important.
[18:21:43] %StalluManu: Randomness is gathered from various sources. Traditionally your cpu's tick counter is one.
[18:21:52] %StalluManu: Running programs and their memory space is another.
[18:22:02] %StalluManu: User input is an important one in linux.
[18:22:08] %StalluManu: As well as USB bus communication.
[18:22:18] %StalluManu: Want weird random numbers? plug a fuckton if I/O devices into your USB ports.
[18:22:49] %StalluManu: Now, a STRONG random number generator has a LOW Likelihood of producing repeating segments.
[18:22:52] %StalluManu: repeating segments are bad.
[18:23:01] %StalluManu: because a salt of aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa is easy as fuck to guess.

[18:23:54] %StalluManu: if you don't know what that means, google it.
[18:24:06] %StalluManu: So, that's how a salt is generated.
[18:24:19] %StalluManu: Now back to the point: there are truecrypt bruteforcers out there.
[18:24:26] Agrajag (~harhar@LulzCo-6C4BAAB9.bu.edu) joined the channel.
[18:24:48] %StalluManu: Fortunately, truecrypt stores it's key headers in the last and first 128kb of the encrypted partition (first 512 and last 512 bytes block, but it's safer to encrypt more).
[18:25:06] %StalluManu: So what we'll do is encrypt those blocks with another encryption tool, that is way slower.
[18:25:45] %StalluManu: Extract the decrypted blocks to a overlay for an overlay FS in RAM for the encrypted image.
[18:25:56] %StalluManu: voilla, something the FBI doesn't have a program to bruteforce.
[18:26:08] %StalluManu: Now, Fox, do you still have that ling to paranoiacrypt?

[18:30:17] %StalluManu: Now, what this does.
[18:30:25] +darkspline: StalluManu, thank you btw
[18:30:39] %StalluManu: It encrypts single files using 3 algorithms, one after another, in XTS chaining mode.
[18:30:50] %StalluManu: XTS chaining is a way to turn a block cipher into a stream cipher (google it faggot).
[18:31:05] MrLinux (~mail@LulzCo-4D35FFA3.goeaston.net) left IRC.
[18:31:20] %StalluManu: Now, it uses 3* aes-256, 3* whirlpool and 3* serpent to encrypt data.
[18:31:32] %StalluManu: meaning that if you forget the key, the sun will burn out and the fucking universe will die before you recover it.
[18:31:36] %StalluManu: in XTS mode, that's 18 keys.
[18:31:42] %StalluManu: 18 256-bits keys.
[18:31:54] %StalluManu: Speaking of bitcounts: 256 bits encryption for civies is illegal in the US of anus.
[18:32:09] %StalluManu: So hide the damn binary.
[18:32:24] %StalluManu: Now, this program is really fucking slow.
[18:32:33] %StalluManu: On an opteron, it takes 1.5-2 seconds to generate a hash from a key.

[18:39:59] @halfdead: (which one)
[18:40:02] %StalluManu: This will write as fast as your disk will go, as opposed to the fucking slow /dev/urandom.
[18:40:06] %StalluManu: halfdead: last one.
[18:40:17] @halfdead: k
[18:40:17] %StalluManu: And it's a stronger RNG than /dev/urandom.
[18:40:33] @halfdead: dude
[18:40:40] %StalluManu: ya?
[18:40:57] @halfdead: /dev/urandom is awesome when you do for instance dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda1
[18:41:05] @halfdead: or whatever the primary partition is
[18:41:18] %StalluManu: halfdead: yeah, i know, but it's slow, and not as random as mtwister.
[18:41:19] ~Fox: NOOB NOTE:

[18:42:25] %StalluManu: or, you know, google.
[18:42:31] %StalluManu: Now, we have a disk of random shit.
[18:42:39] %StalluManu: Now we need a password to give to the feds.
[18:42:56] %StalluManu: We encrypt the first part of the partition with one password, the one that you want to hand out.
[18:43:02] %StalluManu: like the first ~30% or so.
[18:43:15] %StalluManu: (the pass you hand out in case they beat you over the head with a wrench).
[18:43:30] %StalluManu: This part contains a basic linux distribution, that YOU LOG IN TO REGULARLY so they cant distinguish it from real.
[18:43:36] %StalluManu: REALLY FUCKING IMPORTANT THAT YOU DO THIS STEP.
[18:44:00] %StalluManu: The second part of the partition (you can grab parts of a partition with dd seek= ) you encrypt with a different key.
[18:44:05] %StalluManu: this key YOU FUCKING KEEP FOR YOURSELF.
[18:44:16] %StalluManu: Remember that encrypted data was indistinguishable from random data?
[18:44:28] %StalluManu: Yeah, so the last part might as well be unpartitioned space.
[18:44:36] %StalluManu: plausible fucking deniability.

[19:06:43] @hatter: even with no listening ports
[19:07:05] %StalluManu: You tunnel trough cloudvpn/proxies to your home box from where you are.

[19:09:07] @hatter: So use I2P
[19:09:15] %StalluManu: better yet, us a private DNS server.
[19:09:17] @hatter: I2P is a peer-to-peer system similar to tor

[19:09:25] %StalluManu: somewhere in a retarded shithole of a country.

[19:19:26] %StalluManu: Ok. someone wanted to know more about ssl certificates.
[19:19:32] %StalluManu: SSL Uses RSA to encrypt a connection.
[19:19:46] %StalluManu: RSA is an assymetric cipher, go to fucking wikipedo.
[19:19:46] @hatter: and is also weak as phuck
[19:19:50] %StalluManu: ^that&
[19:20:09] @hatter: Ultimately though
[19:20:17] @hatter: No encryption matters if it does not have pre-shared keys
[19:20:23] @hatter: Without pre-shared keys
[19:20:25] %StalluManu: It allows you to figure out with some certainty how deeply in the shit you are.
[19:20:31] @hatter: the initial key exchange can be hijacked
[19:20:34] @hatter: and then it won't matter
[19:20:39] @hatter: Even without the SSL MiTM
[19:20:47] @hatter: they can decrypt the data with a plain ole mitm
[19:20:54] %StalluManu: hatter: true.

[19:21:54] @hatter: :P
[19:22:04] %StalluManu: shit like that gives information about who you are and where you live.
[19:22:08] @hatter: lol
[19:22:10] @hatter: Sure it does
[19:22:14] @hatter: More like

[19:25:06] LordKitsuna sets mode +v Anorov
[19:25:23] +srwx: which will prevent a lot of third party advertisers from tracking which websites you visit
[19:25:44] +Anorov: stallumanu, i agree completely
[19:25:53] +Anorov: i'll lay out a real world example
[19:26:14] +Anorov: let's say you're spamming or even trying to hack some site. you're using tor, maybe even a huge variety of proxies
[19:26:33] +Anorov: the server admin sees something funny is going on, checks the access logs. sees the IPs launching the attacks, checks the useragent
[19:26:56] +Anorov: makes a file with all the logs from the past few weeks/months, greps the useragent. if it's unique-ish and if you EVER visited with your real IP, you're fucked
[19:27:16] +Anorov: same with typing patterns. let's say you have some typing quirk you're unaware of and post on some forum frequently. then some guy hacks said forum and posts a deface message with that same quirk
[19:27:18] +Anorov: someone might notice
[19:27:35] %StalluManu: So: spoof your useragent to something common.
[19:27:36] +Anorov: constantly check your writing style and constantly change your useragents if you're targeting a site
[19:27:38] +Anorov: yep
[19:27:40] %StalluManu: Change your nick erryday.
[19:27:44] +Anorov: switch between a few common UA's
[19:27:48] %StalluManu: Dont put private info on public sites.
[19:27:49] +Anorov: firefox 4, IE 8
[19:28:21] %StalluManu: And spoof your shit to that of a dumb windows user.
[19:28:46] %StalluManu: i know for a fact people in here reuse their nicks.
[19:29:01] %StalluManu: 'cause i googled.
[19:29:03] +darkspline: <----
[19:29:03] %StalluManu: i'm not dropping dox, but feel free to come back later with a different fucking handle.
[19:29:07] +Anorov: yep. never join a place like this, or really anywhere, with a nick you use elsewhere, or a nick you have tied to other nicks
[19:29:35] %StalluManu: ok.
[19:29:35] +Anorov: picking a new nick and then saying "my msn is [some fucking msn you use everywhere" will nullify everything you did too
[19:29:47] %StalluManu: Now: how2get a nick.
[19:30:00] %StalluManu: Decide the poor fuck you want to screw over, in a town fucking remote from where you are.
[19:30:03] %StalluManu: Get on his wifi.
[19:30:07] %StalluManu: Make a new irc account under his IP.
[19:30:19] %StalluManu: Then just use a proxy for the rest of the time.

[19:45:57] %StalluManu: chances are you are backdoored now, use tripwire.
[19:46:19] @c0qsm3gma: lol @ tripwire
[19:46:23] %StalluManu: as an extra measure: have hashes of system files on your encrypted partition in your initrd, and hashes of your initrd in your encrypted partition.
[19:46:34] %StalluManu: use a script to check 'em dubs.
[19:46:55] %StalluManu: that way when someone dicks with your initrd but not your encrypted partition (feds having your disk) you know.
[19:47:04] %StalluManu: and when someone dicks with your root but not your /boot you know
[19:47:12] %StalluManu: but omg, cant you change /boot?

[19:48:42] %StalluManu: this is a pain because you'd have to use a livecd to change kernels.
[19:48:44] %StalluManu: but it's worth it.
[19:49:13] %StalluManu: ok, so you've detected a trojan. it hasn't dicked with every ids you have in place.
[19:49:20] %StalluManu: re-emerge the infected package.
[19:49:31] %StalluManu: or: copy over from a backup.
[19:49:37] %StalluManu: (preferably the 1st option)
[19:49:47] %StalluManu: do a offline package install, your distro has a wiki that tells you how 2.

[20:05:20] @c0qsm3gma: LordKitsuna: you are being rude

[20:18:30] %StalluManu: yeah?
[20:18:36] ~Fox: A lovely pro-tip
[20:18:40] +TR0|\|: lol i never said shit about paying :P
[20:18:56] ~Fox: Remember what hatter said about alarms?
[20:19:05] ~Fox: If you cant go in silent, trip as many as possible?
[20:19:06] %StalluManu: yup.
[20:19:19] @c0qsm3gma: lol
[20:19:21] +darkspline: i like

[20:19:26] ~Fox: ProTip: If you are comping a box and want to hide your tracks, post the URL
[20:19:33] +darkspline: now i'm thinking about all the alarms i tripped...
[20:19:33] ~Fox: Do your dirt with a thousand other people trying to get in
[20:19:41] ~Fox: Security via obscurity.
[20:19:45] %StalluManu: Fox: i have a better idea.
[20:19:53] %StalluManu: Everyone hopefully knows how to wget with a tor proxy.
[20:20:01] +darkspline: Fox, offensive obscurification (sp)
[20:20:03] %StalluManu: tor with thousands of requests looks like a botnet.
[20:20:08] ~Fox: There are a million better ideas, just a tip :3
[20:20:26] %StalluManu: use a bash script, wget over a proxy with shellcode, sql, anything you can throw at the server.
[20:20:28] +darkspline: Fox, always a better way..

[20:20:57] %StalluManu: worked b4.
[20:21:05] ~Fox: Truth.
[20:21:21] +TR0|\|: StalluManu should we point out the benefits of a paid vpn over tor or a free vpn/proxy?
[20:21:28] %LordKitsuna: StalluManu, wouldnt a plan like that present the off chance that that admin just takes everything offline while its delt with?

[20:22:09] ~Fox: Fuck Tor has been covered so many goddamn times I can't even define to you.
[20:22:17] ~Fox: StalluManu go go go.
[20:22:19] %StalluManu: TR0: as long as you pay with someone else's account it's all fine.
[20:22:29] %StalluManu: oh. another point
[20:22:34] %StalluManu: if you go carding, or buying accounts.
[20:22:44] %StalluManu: convert to bitcoin, to another stolen paypal, merry go round.
[20:22:50] %StalluManu: da russian way.
[20:22:57] %StalluManu: wonder why bitcoins are worth so much? right
[20:23:14] +darkspline: StalluManu, resources needed to create one
[20:23:18] +darkspline: like... mining for jems
[20:23:32] +darkspline: only so many cpu's available
[20:24:04] %StalluManu: also, good suggestion, you can use a paypal debit card dropped off @ a dead drop for getting money.
[20:25:05] ~Fox: +7 for fraud talk
[20:25:05] %StalluManu: now, there's a legal disclaimer, i am obviously not asking you to do any kind of criminal activity, etcetera.
[20:25:25] %StalluManu: but it's hella lulzy to ddos someone from the cloud paid for with their own cash.
[20:26:41] %StalluManu: The offensive side of this is of course that more money transferred to bitcoin or shit not connected to your person can buy you cool stuff.
[20:26:51] %StalluManu: SIM cards and cellphones.
[20:27:01] %StalluManu: prepaid ccs.

[20:34:18] +imposter22: as anyone who knows anything about skimming
[20:34:45] +imposter22: there are 2/3 lines of code that arnt even encrypted on credit cards
[20:35:00] +imposter22: bank number. routing number/ name/ exp date
[20:35:14] +imposter22: all this info is saved temp in logs on all their hdd's
[20:35:38] +imposter22: which is why most stores are very secure with the old (even bad replaced hdd's)
[20:35:58] +imposter22: they log customer spending like crazy
[20:36:06] +imposter22: its a whole tracking system
[20:36:20] %StalluManu: imposter: i got some info on that too.
[20:36:30] %StalluManu: i've been in the netherlands for a while, and seen the NCR.
[20:36:43] %StalluManu: they are NOT that much into scrunity for their machines hdds.
[20:36:53] %StalluManu: THEIR atms do log cc numbers.
[20:37:04] %StalluManu: if you are lucky you can fish an atm from the trash and literally get a root image.
[20:37:09] %StalluManu: most of the shit on it is still xp + visual basic.
[20:37:21] +imposter22: yes... but thats not really NCR that does that
[20:37:24] +imposter22: that is the actual bank
[20:37:28] %StalluManu: true.
[20:37:35] %StalluManu: but they return 'em to the ncr for repairs.
[20:37:36] +imposter22: NCR supplies the equipment.. software is run through the banking company
[20:37:38] %StalluManu: ncr tosses them.
[20:37:44] %StalluManu: bingo, hdd.
[20:37:48] +imposter22: well... no
[20:38:10] +imposter22: companies have contracts with NCR and IBM and others to send the hdd's in for distruction
[20:38:21] +imposter22: this is a MUST for ATMS and backoffice servers
[20:38:27] +imposter22: they dont just toss those ones
[20:38:42] %StalluManu: uhh.. then where did someone who is not me get those root images with cc dumps from?
[20:38:45] %StalluManu: thin air?
[20:38:45] +Shidash: Does anyone know of places to get good proxies? Paid proxies are okay, just looking for the best ones possible.

[20:40:03] +imposter22: what these companies dont know is how easy it is for a tech (not me :]) to just steal shit like crazy
[20:40:27] +imposter22: its amazing the securty they take from the general public... but leave the tech with a big securty gap
[20:41:09] %StalluManu: also ATM botnets r cool.
[20:41:13] +imposter22: a tech could skim 1000's of creditcards... get the ip address of the corp hq for the reimaging servers for the retail client
