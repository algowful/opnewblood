<Sav>	before I get sushis
<Sav>	So
<Sav>	Building sources, I'll assume you're on Linux
<hatter>	Once you've extracted the compression archive, open a terminal
and cd to the folder it extracted to
<Sav>	but most of this can apply to OSX, too
<hatter>	^
<Sav>	open a terminal, xterm, gnome-terminal, whatever
<Sav>	you first download the source package
<Sav>	or change directory to that one
<Sav>	for the newcomers
<Sav>	cd /path/the/the/directory/where/the/file/lies
<Sav>	then
<Sav>	usually, you'll have to decompress a .tar.gz archive
<Sav>	tar xvzf my.sourcE.package.tar.gz
<Sav>	you'll see a bunch of file names output
<Sav>	it will tell you in what directory it's been extacted
<Sav>	+r
<Sav>	you change to this directory
<Sav>	then
<Sav>	you'll be doing some MAGIC
<Sav>	you'll type ./configure
<Sav>	most of time
<Sav>	you'll have a configure script, that's a Unix de facto standard, most
often, it's based on autoconf.
<Sav>	so, running ./configure will bootstrap the program compilation
<Sav>	i.e. prepare the source for real compilation
<Sav>	then
<Sav>	you'll CHECK THE OUTPUT
<Sav>	because often it'll be interesting
<Sav>	you'll miss some libraries, or will want to enable additional
functionalities (follow my look towards OpenSSL)
<Sav>	install these libs
<Sav>	if you want
<Sav>	and rerun ./configure, with your options
<Sav>	might be like
<Sav>	./configure --with-more-sugar --with-more-fun --with-openssl
<Sav>	and so on
<Sav>	(that's optional)
<Sav>	then
<Sav>	make
<Sav>	will do the actual compilation, i.e. conversion to machine code,
linking, and family
<Sav>	if it doesn't work
<Sav>	you did it wrong
<Sav>	double check the stels
<Sav>	steps
<Sav>	and read the README or INSTALL file
<Sav>	one thing
<Sav>	always READ THE DOCS
<Sav>	ok
<Sav>	so let's assume make has completed
<Sav>	you'll then want to strip your binaries
<Sav>	to remove useless crap from them
<Sav>	that is
<Sav>	strip path/to/binary/file
<Sav>	protip, to find the binary
<Sav>	searchfor a file with exec permissions
<Sav>	that is, using find
<Sav>	(I'm reading the man)
<Sav>	find . -mode u=x 
<Sav>	or rather
<Sav>	find . -type f -mode u=x
<Sav>	and then
<Sav>	you'll want to type
<Sav>	make install
<Sav>	that's it
<Sav>	if you download a binary, usually it will come with a makefile too
<Sav>	you'll just have to cd to the directory where the makefile lies
<Sav>	and do
<Sav>	make install
<Sav>	that's it.
<Sav>	Google Makefile, now, and learn more about it.
<Sav>	End if impromptu class. Questions?
