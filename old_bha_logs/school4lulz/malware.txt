    [22:01] <~Fox> Alright we're going back to doing this open forum style
    [22:01] <~Fox> back to square one
    [22:01] <~Fox> back to grind time
    [22:02] <~Fox> Ok kids
    [22:02] <~Fox> tweeted for the remainders
    [22:02] <~Fox> so first things first
    [22:03] <Zippie> may I suggest anything that requires a ton of discussion, be linked to, such as a pastebin

    [22:03] <~Fox> moment of silence, for fallen comrades.
    [22:03] <~Fox> Kay, now that thats done with. Fuck whitehats, get off mah dicccccccccccccckkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
    [22:03] <~Fox> Anyways
    [22:03] <WOOTAnonymous> xD
    [22:03] <~Fox> Malware
    [22:03] <~Fox> so what we're talking about here
    [22:04] <~Fox> is pretty much anything that is 'bad software'
    [22:04] * iS4ber (chris@AN-poq.pai.ha358e.IP) has joined #school4lulz
    [22:04] <~Fox> that is persistent, and allows some sort of bad thing to happen
    [22:04] <~Fox> whether that be ad-ware that's used to pipe into affiliate scams
    [22:04] <~Fox> or a trojan to view a victim
    [22:04] <~Fox> botnet executable, rootkit, backdoor
    [22:04] <~Fox> lots of stuff will fall under this category
    [22:05] <~Fox> really this talk is to familiarize you with them, so with further talks on more specific subjects as we go along, I don't have you retards asking questions like 'HERP DERP. HOW DO I BIND AN EXE TO A WEBSITE'
    [22:05] <~Fox> That was a really annoying question for the record.
    [22:05] <~Fox> Anyways, lets get started with the base level that you all will probably be working with which will be trojans.
    [22:05] <~Fox> Anyone here fuckin with a trojan right now?

    [22:06] <@Bratty> on this hd no ;x
    [22:06] <WebAnon19871> hey
    [22:06] <NOF4CE> ive been messing with botnet stuff

    [22:06] <~Fox> You packed it up?

    [22:06] <~Fox> menot: you are obviously a troll
    [22:06] <WOOTAnonymous> kiddie stuff
    [22:06] <WebAnon46817> wats going on
    [22:07] <NOF4CE> ok back to fox :p
    [22:07] <~Fox> So point of the loaded question was to say that any trojan that you pick up
    [22:07] <Zippie> +m to keep on subject?
    [22:07] <~Fox> sure
    [22:07] <~Fox> ask for voice.
    [22:07] * Fox sets mode: +m
    [22:07] <~Fox> You're going to have to put in mad work into any trojan you find commercially available

    [22:08] <~Fox> back in my day, I LOVED ME SOME POISON GODDAMN IVY
    [22:08] <~Fox> I had nets on PI of over a thousand plus users
    [22:08] * Bratty sets mode: +v Zippie
    [22:08] <~Fox> It pays to know what people are doing  when they think no one is watching
    [22:09] <~Fox> Now that brings us over to crypters, actual packing, there are talks in the archives from XO on executable packaging
    [22:09] <~Fox> I'm not going to go in depth in that in this particular talk, if a rehash is needed, we will get to it
    [22:10] <~Fox> But a crypter, either purchased, or built is a literal must in order to prevent your payload once the box has been exploited in whatever fashion, social or technical, from being detected and removed.
    [22:10] * happyandfree (happyandfree@AN-4di.197.ign5ic.IP) has joined #school4lulz
    [22:10] <~Fox> Moving down the line to botnet exectuables, you all seen the botnet talks?
    [22:10] <~Fox> If not, go read em, they're good, they have live links to active source code, for Zeus. http CNC
    [22:10] <~Fox> Command and Control for you retards
    [22:10] <+greatvon> no was looking for archives
    [22:11] <~Fox> Sec, let me find you the link
    [22:11] <+greatvon> if someone wants to ping me a link :D
    [22:11] <~Fox> sec
    [22:11] <+greatvon> it can wait till after fox
    [22:11] <~Fox> I'll upload
    [22:12] <~Fox> Anyways, botnet exectuables are TRIPLY important here
    [22:12] <~Fox> You are exposing your executable to THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS of machines
    [22:12] <~Fox> To ID, Sandbox, and report back on your executable
    [22:12] <~Fox> change it up often, and change it up a lot
    [22:12] <~Fox> Do that, and your net will stay 100.
    [22:13] <~Fox> http://dsmca.com/zeus.rar
    [22:13] <~Fox> Word to Zlex
    [22:13] <~Fox> That is the link to the zeus sorce.
    [22:13] <+greatvon> nice
    [22:13] <~Fox> Don't be dumb and try and just rail that out standard.
    [22:14] <~Fox> Now what you're all probably saying is
    [22:14] <~Fox> FOX HOW DOES I GET BOTS/ZOMBIES/VIC TO GET IT IN FIRST PLACE?!!?!?
    [22:14] <~Fox> I'll get to that little ones
    [22:14] <~Fox> Anyways moving down the line again
    [22:14] <+greatvon> zeus source rar is passworded
    [22:14] <@orbital> password is zeus
    [22:15] <~Fox> lol. faggots.
    [22:15] <~Fox> anyways.
    [22:15] <~Fox> Backdoors
    [22:15] <~Fox> backdoors are a lot of things, the tried, trusted, and true c99 PHP shell and r57
    [22:15] <~Fox> are phenomenal examples of this
    [22:15] <~Fox> tools of the trade when I was a young buck
    [22:15] <~Fox> still around to this day
    [22:16] <~Fox> Then you look at other files that once a box has been compromised you are able to literally replace non-used services with your backdoor
    [22:16] <~Fox> Note the talk in #school on port knocking
    [22:16] <~Fox> It looks like nothing is wrong, until you initiate that connection
    [22:16] <~Fox> if you're dedicated to it
    [22:17] <~Fox> you can even make that connection appear to be legitimate
    [22:17] <~Fox> connection masking is once again a bit out of scope of this little talk right here, but once again, very valid and mentionable.
    [22:17] <~Fox> So, we covered backdoors
    [22:18] <~Fox> Orbital
    [22:18] <@orbital> yes?
    [22:18] <~Fox> You want to take a crack at rootkits for the kids?

    [22:20] <@orbital> Basicly a root kit is a piece of software that you install after you've "rooted" the box in order to hide and maintain your access
    [22:20] <@orbital> There are many different root kits
    [22:20] <@orbital> Whether you override certain system features
    [22:21] <@orbital> Or even flash a certain part of the computer hardware
    [22:21] * baWs3 (baWs3@i.luv.this.game) has joined #school4lulz
    [22:21] <@orbital> (for example flashing the firmware of the keyboard or something similar to maintain your access very long)
    [22:22] * Winston (Winston@AN-vv7.249.f6tjlg.IP) has joined #school4lulz
    [22:22] <@orbital> there are also certain root kits which allow you gain access on the pc during the boot
    [22:22] <@orbital> to keylogg bios or truecrypt passwords
    [22:22] <~Fox> These are referred to as 'Ring' states
    [22:22] <~Fox> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_%28computer_security%29
    [22:23] <~Fox> Please continue, just helping out, you're doing fine :)
    [22:23] <@orbital> root kits (especially ones that are not widely known) are a great way to make sure your malware doesnt get detected very soon
    [22:24] <@orbital> hm thinking about more stuff one moment
    [22:24] <~Fox> For example
    [22:25] <~Fox> a combination of different types of malware would be
    [22:25] <~Fox> The Storm Worm
    [22:25] <~Fox> Which i'm sure a lot of you remember if you read RSS feeds and shit
    [22:26] <~Fox> Storm, first compromised the machine, and attempted persistence of itself, via a rootkit on the box, something to stay persistent, then pushing its payload of the botnet exectuable, and those hooks into the system from there
    [22:26] <~Fox> Usually these pieces of malware from a removal perspective are damned near impossible.
    [22:26] <~Fox> Where orbital mentioned flashing, one of my colleagues FAVORITE PLACES
    [22:26] <~Fox> were vid-card firmware.
    [22:27] <~Fox> You don't really need a lot of space, if you're going for the big fuck you
    [22:27] <~Fox> small, hidden, tidy code, is what you're going for
    [22:27] <~Fox> this is where building your own really really fucking counts
    [22:27] <~Fox> occasionally you can get a hook up on these sorts of things, but it's very rare
    [22:28] <~Fox> These are things that people slave over, but at the same time, the benefits of coding such a kit are beyond literal words
    [22:28] <~Fox> A good kit, can last you years, upon years, whereas a executable, you're lucky if it lasts over a month on a US machine
    [22:28] <@orbital> Well yeah to make the removal particularly hard one should use multiple root kit methods
    [22:28] <~Fox> all bets are off in korea though
    [22:28] <~Fox> poor bastards.
    [22:28] <+greatvon> lol
    [22:29] <~Fox> orbital is right
    [22:29] <~Fox> note the storm worm, and pretty much any other malware example
    [22:29] <~Fox> Multiple infection methods,
    [22:29] <~Fox> multiple exploitation methods
    [22:29] <~Fox> multiple reciprocation methods
    [22:29] <~Fox> The more variables there are
    [22:29] <~Fox> the harder it is to pin down
    [22:30] <~Fox> So lets get on to actual compromisation and planting
    [22:30] <~Fox> what you're going to be looking to do is either remote exploitation
    [22:30] <~Fox> binded executable
    [22:30] <@orbital> to a website
    [22:30] <~Fox> or my personal favorite
    [22:30] <~Fox> social engineering
    [22:30] <~Fox> orbital yes, web exploitation with dne or rce can do it
    [22:30] <~Fox> but payloads like that are FAR AND FEW in between these days
    [22:31] <~Fox> I havent seen a good browser rce in a hot minute
    [22:31] <@orbital> i was referring to "how do i bind a exe to a website" tho lol
    [22:31] <~Fox> lol
    [22:31] <~Fox> <3
    [22:32] <@orbital> Most attacks require at least some social engineering these days
    [22:32] <~Fox> Binded exectuable refers to Executable A, which runs in the foreground, and executable B that runs in the background away from the users eye
    [22:32] * doc (im@real.doctor) has left #school4lulz
    [22:32] <~Fox> Also Social Engineering Toolkit
    [22:32] <~Fox> js
    [22:33] <~Fox> So from there you're looking at remote exploitation,
    [22:33] <~Fox> That's covered in Ms Parker's MetaSploit drive by talk
    [22:33] <~Fox> good way to start an exe.
    [22:33] <~Fox> I'll get you those links here shortly.
    [22:34] <~Fox> Social engineering is just a matter of getting someone to run that executable for whatever reason.
    [22:34] <@Bratty> Wanna see my porns boys?
    [22:34] <~Fox> Pretty fucking simple shit there, unless you're a tard or come at them shady about it
    [22:34] <@Bratty> ;x
    [22:34] <~Fox> See.
    [22:34] <~Fox> You all would have got GOT
    [22:34] <~Fox> RIGHT THERE
    [22:34] <~Fox> BY BRATTY
    [22:34] <~Fox> SOCIAL
    [22:34] <@orbital> Social engineering does get a lot easier in combination with certain exploits
    [22:34] <~Fox> ENGINEERING
    [22:34] <~Fox> Indeed
    [22:34] <~Fox> so lets take some questions and shit
    [22:34] * Fox sets mode: -m
    [22:35] <~Fox> Sup kids
    [22:35] <@Bratty> they are all busy msging me for the link ;x
    [22:35] <~Fox> lewl
    [22:35] <NOF4CE> Im questionless lol
    [22:35] <@Bratty> SE is the ultimate in hacking tools
    [22:36] <NOF4CE> honestly your covering this well
    [22:36] <~Fox> Thanks.
    [22:36] <~Fox> I do what I can
    [22:36] <~Fox> I try and work from the base up
    [22:36] <@Bratty> out of everything you could possibly learn its both the hardest skill & the best skill imho
    [22:36] <turbopinko> theres not much else besides how do you write your own rootkit
    [22:36] <~Fox> Malware was something I dont think we really did a fucking 'DERP WAT IS THIS'
    [22:36] <~Fox> kind of class
    [22:36] <MrWonderful> question
    [22:36] <~Fox> Sup
    [22:36] <NOF4CE> yeh root kits are just something i dont want to think about
    [22:37] <+greatvon> I am fine with the malware side, its the fucking rootkit and keeping access I have issues with
    [22:37] <baWs3> any good framework to start a rootkit?
    [22:37] <+greatvon> my shit lasts like a week then gets fucked of the machine
    [22:37] <MrWonderful> rootkit keeps your malware active?
    [22:37] <@yngjungian> What is dne and rce?

    [22:38] <@orbital> a root kit ensures that when your malware gets deleted
    [22:38] <~Fox> MrWonderful: It keeps your access
    [22:38] <menot> Is there info about injecting code to firmware/eeproms in the webs?
    [22:38] <@orbital> it will do some action
    [22:38] <@orbital> like redownload or sth
    [22:38] <~Fox> also baWs3 check out some rootkits around and check some code
    [22:38] <+greatvon> I cant find much mrnot
    [22:38] <~Fox> thats the best place to start
    [22:38] <@orbital> or the rootkit is your malware
    [22:38] <@orbital> but thats rare
    [22:38] <thz_nmr> yeah...more info about how to inject code into a firmware would be great

    [22:41] <thz_nmr> thx greatvon
    [22:41] <h0ll0w> check out blackbuntu.com ubuntu security distro
    [22:41] <@orbital> thz_nmr http://www.securitytube.net/video/822 this one example of how one would flash a firmware (even tho its for mac the basics apply for windows too)
    [22:41] <baWs3> rootkit hides in lower level or ring
    [22:41] <@orbital> MrWonderful the rootkit is very tiny and well hidden
    [22:41] <thz_nmr> thx!
    [22:41] <@orbital> either very low level
    [22:42] <@orbital> like in the ring
    [22:42] <@orbital> or on hardware
    [22:42] <@orbital> like your keyboard
    [22:42] <@orbital> or battery in a laptop even
    [22:42] <menot> nice
    [22:42] <MrWonderful> i seee!
    [22:42] <h0ll0w> wasnt some guy trying to get a battery to explode by hacking?
    [22:42] <+greatvon> https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-07/Heasman/Presentation/bh-usa-07-heasman.pdf some more shit on bios rootkits and suchlike
    [22:43] <baWs3> charlie
    [22:43] <@orbital> dunno havent heard of that
    [22:43] <baWs3> and it didnt explode
    [22:43] <baWs3> 0xcharlie i think on twitter
    [22:43] <h0ll0w> hence "trying"
    [22:43] <turbopinko> you can put  a root kit on mac batteries i guess
    [22:43] <@orbital> yes
    [22:44] <@orbital> you can put a root kit on anything on mac lol
    [22:44] <turbopinko> for sure
    [22:44] <baWs3> uh oh
    [22:44] <~Fox> +1
    [22:44] <@orbital> look at the video i posted
    [22:44] <h0ll0w> i suppose av wouldnt pick it up on a battery
    [22:44] <@orbital> security is like not existant there
    [22:44] <@orbital> :P
    [22:44] <h0ll0w> what about ubuntu?
    [22:44] <thz_nmr> image the possibilities on universities :P
