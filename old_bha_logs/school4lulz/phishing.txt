20:56 < algidLogic> that was sweet
20:56 <@God> So phishing?
20:57 <@God> who here is a professional phisherman
20:57 < vongreat> not much anymore
20:57 <@God> ok 
20:57 <@God> so the art on phishing 
20:57 <@God> i never thought about this till not long ago
20:57 <@God> when the Social engineer tool kit came out
20:57 <@God> but phishing is very much like socialing
20:58 <@God> and in todays inet world is easier then ever
20:58 <@God> with browsers able to save whole websites
20:58 <@God> all you need is a little something to send you the name and pw
20:58 <@God> i sometimes use a php script
20:58 <@God> which i will paste bin once ark is done downloading
20:59 <@God> its all in the delivery 
20:59 <@God> winsock spamming works great with phishing
20:59 <@God> but you can be traced like that
20:59 <@God> which is best used on hacked wifi
20:59 <@God> or you can just send mail normally with a made up acct
20:59 <@God> say i want to steal a yahoo
21:00 <@God> i will make a email account such as ymail.alert@yahoo.com
21:00 <@God> or something a little more believable
21:01 < vongreat> gmail is great for it as you can set the name to whatever like GMAIL TEAM and th emails show as GMAIL TEAM in inbox
21:02 <@God> http://pastebin.com/LFBy3ghL
21:02 <@God> that is the php script
21:02 <@God> what you want to do is use a host that will support php
21:02 <@God> such as oni.cc
21:02 <@God> http://oni.cc
21:02 <@God> and you get a site you want to use
21:02 <@God> so you need to find out what u wanna steal first
21:03 <@God> so if i wanted to pose as a yahoo.com
21:03 <@God> i would search yahoo
21:03 <@God> for different login pages
21:03 <@God> also when you search websites for different types of login pages
21:04 <@God> you sometimes will find small exploits
21:04 <@God> but thats another topic
21:04 <@God> right click save the site as source code
21:04 <@God> rename it to a html file
21:04 <@God> and then check the site to make sure all images and scripts work
21:04 < algidLogic> you cant just save the html
21:04 <@God> make it back to a txt file
21:04 <@God> u can save it as txt
21:04 < algidLogic> what about all the links for images and such
21:04 <@God> and rename it to .html
21:04 < algidLogic> ?
21:05 <@God> and its fine
21:05 < algidLogic> the paths will be all wrong
21:05 <@God> well back in the day it was harder
21:05 <@God> look
21:05 <@God> no they are not
21:05 <@orbital> there are tools for cloning
21:05 <@God> https://login.yahoo.com/config/login_verify2?&.src=ym
21:05 <@orbital> SET can e.g.
21:06 <@God> u hardly need a tool for any cloning
21:06 <@God> if anything u might need to fix one image
21:06 <@God> and all u need to do for that
21:06 <@God> is locate the image in the txt file u saved
21:06 < Komar> Also, when fishing don't forget to obfuscate your url's -- it's pretty nifty.
21:06 <@God> and add the domain name in front of it
21:06 < Komar> phishing*
21:06 <@God> after you have your site and its ready to be used you need to do a search in the txt file for "post"
21:06 <+Zippie> always +m unless you are asking questions
21:07 <@God> <form method="post" action="https://login.yahoo.com/config/login?" autocomplete="" name="login_form" id="login_form" onsubmit="return hash2(this)">
21:07 <@God> so you see the "post"
21:07 <@God> thats the only thing u'll ever really need to change your site
21:07 <@God> in the txt file
21:07 <@God> after to have uploaded your php script that i just pasted bin
21:08 <@God> u need to make sure that the input names id's are the same as the php script as in ur txt file of the site u are cloning
21:08 <@God>  <input name='passwd' id='passwd' type='password' maxlength='64' tabindex='2'>
21:08 <@God> that is the password feild
21:08 <@God> yahoo uses and id of
21:08 <@God> passwd
21:08 <@God> but the php script says password
21:09 <@God> so u can change the php script or change the txt of yahoo site, it does not really matter
21:09 <+Zippie> If I may suggest, any time you are phishing, be sure to send the login information along to the real server, and transfer the cookies to the user, so they never know it even happend.
21:09 <@God> after you make a site such as yahoo.oni.cc
21:10 <@God> if you must but its not always eneded
21:10 <@God> lot of people are already logged into the domaiin when they get the emails
21:10 <@God> so where ever ur php redirects them will be fine
21:10 <@God> such as calendar.yahoo.com
21:10 <@orbital> Zippie "send .. along to the real server" i'd suggest doing the opposite as the SOP will probably fuck you otherwise :P
21:10 <@God> it will load jkust like normal
21:10 <+Zippie> k
21:10 <@God> anyways
21:10 <@God> just change the 
21:11 <@God> "post" url with ur php script
21:11 <@God> Dear Employees:      We ask that our employees please take a moment to update the Name, location, and Phone Number on your Employee Phone Records by going <a href="">here.</a>    Current information allows for faster verification when another employee need to fine you or when OpsSec pulls up your account. From time to time we may also use this information to 
21:11 <@God> i have phished entire call centers
21:11 <@God> one after another
21:12 <@God> with only phish scams
21:12 <@God> phishing is just as effective as any other hacking attempt
21:12 <@God> you can phish ip's
21:12 <@God> you can fish logins
21:12 <@God> cc's
21:12 <@God> whatever
21:12 <@God> its all in your delivery 
21:13 <@God> when you are finished and u;ve uploaded your php and site
21:13 <@God> such as
21:13 <@God> yahoo.oni.cc/login.psp
21:13 <@God> and your victim log's in
21:13 <@God> you will find your phish'd victims info on
21:13 <@God> whatever txt you edited in the php script
21:13 <@God> such as
21:13 <@God> yahoo.oni.cc/cc.txt
21:14 <@God> and you can edit the cmd in the file with a ftp program
21:14 <@God> so it cant be viewed
21:14 <@God> for other people to view it
21:14 <@God> only writes
21:14 <@God> so u just ftp in and u got it
21:14 <@God> or build a small program that will just read it and sit on ur desktop
21:14 <@God> i have one that sites right by my clock on my windows box
21:14 <@God> whenever someone log's in
21:14 <@God> it just shows up
21:15 <@God> hold on i need to check the bbq
21:15 <@God> any questions?
21:16 <@orbital> hm nope
21:16 <~Fox> ROUND 1.
21:16 <@God> im trying to find sites i already have up to show people but
21:17 <@God> i forgot my login to one of my 100's of emails
21:17 <@God> if you are trying to scam call centers and log the people off the inet after they login i also have an error html site
21:18 <@God> that will loop a box over and over till they ctrl alt del
21:18 <@God> but thats for call centers where the employees have secure ID's tied to the acct 
21:19 <@God> which is a 6 digit number that changes every 30 seconds after they login with there normal name:pw
