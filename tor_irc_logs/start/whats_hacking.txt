<kr0> lets get it going

<benis> is shitflooding an irc channel hacking? :p

<kr0> I'll cover a few things
<kr0> > Hacking today
<kr0> > abit of Hacking ethics 
<kr0> > and How everything will turn out

<kr0> Okay
<kr0> HACKING EVOLUUUUUTION

<kr0> the work of a security guy was pretty simple back then
<kr0> NOBODY and I mean NOBODY applied Patches 

<kr0> all you had to do is 
<kr0> > Port scan (Nmap)
<kr0> > Banner grab
<kr0> get a exploit
<kr0> booom
<kr0> > Profit
<kr0> Nowadays it changed
<kr0> (except Sony)

<anonymous> lol

<kr0> More and more people apply patches
<kr0> The software is easier to handle
<kr0> and everyone likes to be a security guy

<benis> security is really easy until you have to actually do your job
<kr0> may you noticed the TalkTalk hack from a few months back
<kr0> You know what the hackers used ?
<kr0> SQLMAP

<benis> really?

<kr0> a automated SQL explotaion tool
<kr0> 8 Million people were affected 
<kr0> Little kids used a KNOWN Tool to hack a Company

<kr0> > Known Pattern 
<kr0> > Known Vuln

<kr0> everything was known 
<kr0> and people were still able to fuck up baaadly

<kr0> The whole game changed
<kr0> Most of the modern day hacks/leaks are caused by WebApp Flaws
<kr0> SQLi / RCE / LFIs
<kr0> No Zerodays
<kr0> CUMMON Vulns
<kr0> Why ?
<kr0> people like to apply 'Cool Stuff'

<kr0> Wordpress for example
<kr0> alot of Plugins
<kr0> and alot of possible ways to fuck up

<benis> wordpress is a good unauthenticated web shell with a side feature of being a blog

<kr0> pretty much
<kr0> People like to get a "All in one Package"
<kr0> No Devs 
<kr0> No work
<benis> no brain
<kr0> NO GOD DAMN SECURITY
<kr0> Things are getting old and Vuln
<benis> linux mint got their linux images backdoored from skids breaking wordpress
<kr0> and there are tools out there exploiting these Vulns by a Point-Click action

<benis> so it can happen to anyone

<kr0> and this can be dangerous af
<kr0> Look at Linux Mint
<kr0> Millions of Users 
<kr0> rekt by Wordpress
<benis> (this is why you always verify gpg sigs)
<kr0> ^

<kr0> Imagine the Damage if they didn't patched it real quick
<kr0> anyways
<benis> Imagine the damage if it wasn't just skids

<DLF> wat is skid ?
<kr0> Thats why
<kr0> alot of people (Including me ) changed their way to work over to Web App Sec
<kr0> People don't even Port Scan anymore at this point

<kr0> Okay

<kr0> before I go to my next Topic , are there any questions related to that ?

*** Modus #school4lulz -m by kr0

<kr0> no ?

<benis> ask questions
<zelith> no
<Gaylien> how exactly to gpg test a downloaded iso?
<zero> just joined so nop
<anonymous> good question
<xerxes> that is a good question
<zelith> i use kali linux is that fine

<benis> gpg --verify somefile.iso.asc
<benis> i think
<butts> https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x135.html
<Gaylien> i need to download the key first?

<zelith> also can they be brute forced 
<benis> yes and verify the key, and trust the key
<benis> not really
<z3r0phr34k> hi
<kr0> zelith: I'll come to that In a minute
<benis> the fingerprints yes
<Gaylien> great!
<zelith> ok thanks
<anakata> yeah, the web of trust is a complex thing
<kr0> good ?
<butts> tor has a good page on how to verify signatures of their packages/installers https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en
<benis> too complex IMO
<butts> you can use that and apply it to other isntances
<benis> anyways

<benis> back to hacking

*** Modus #school4lulz +m by kr0

<benis> what is.... this hacking?
<kr0> Okay , Hacking you hear that alot 

<kr0> There is no real definition for the Term
<kr0> so basically 
<kr0> There is 

<kr0> Hardware Hacking
<kr0> Software Hacking 
<kr0> > RE
<benis> Social Hacking

<kr0> Big one
<kr0> If you use the term "Hacking"
<kr0> You mean alot of things
<kr0> SO
<kr0> If I ever hear that question again " how to hack ? "
<kr0> I'll kick ur ass
<butts> The term hacking originates to the MIT Tech Model Railroad Club. The original meaning for a "hacker" was someone who applies ingenuity to create a clever result, known as a "hack"
<kr0> You can hack ATMs
<kr0> You can hack Toasters

<kr0> You can hack Websites
<kr0> You can hack People
<kr0> alot of ways
<DLF> and Shaq
-*- anonymous literally hacks people into pieces
<kr0> c ?

<kr0> Thats why people could misunderstood your questions .. " how to hack ?"
<kr0> Okay
<kr0> back to the definition we all love 
<kr0> "hacking teh Planets"

<benis> unauthenticated access to computer systems

<kr0> Okay
<kr0> back from APPLY A PATCH YOU FAG 
<kr0> To ./sqlmap.py -u http://fbi.gov
<kr0> see a pattern ?

<kr0> People made those mistakes
<benis> people continue to make those mistakes
<kr0> build shitty Web Apps
<kr0> are just stupid
<benis> with the rise in "learning to code" it will get worse

<kr0> So hacking anything isn't hard at all
<ad3pt> using a feature built into the software is just using a feature, its not hacking.

<kr0> Thanks for the ads 
<ad3pt> just wanted to put that out there
<kr0> fair enough
<kr0> Like I said
<kr0> "What is hacking?" is a question of definition
<kr0> The media calls a ordinary DoS , a hack

<benis> and the the law has a very broad net that it casts on what "hacking" is. i.e. weev at&t crap
<kr0> and uber leets WANT A 0DAY

<kr0> exactly
<kr0> so 
<kr0> Hacker ethics
<benis> so what happens is that any kiddo that finds a bug is LE EBIN HAXOR now it seems?
<kr0> I'll keep it short
<kr0> benis: pretty much
<kr0> If you're getting to know Computers , you're awesome
<kr0> If you're getting to know Code , you're awesome as well


<kr0> If you're using that Knowledge to fuck with people , its non of my business
<kr0> Now

<kr0> If you're using that knowledge to really fuck with people , Ransomeware on Hospitals for example
<kr0> You're a huge faggot
<anonymous> with alot of money
<anonymous> ^_^
<kr0> DONT UNDERESTIMATE MY POINT
<kr0> its true tho
<benis> ransomware can be bought as a kit
<benis> so it's rather skidish
<butts> but hey, good job if you hit a bank, police station, corporation, insurance company, debt collection agency, military or state establishment with it
<anonymous> what isnt skidish?
<butts> ;)
<anonymous> ;)
<kr0> I think morals shouldn't be thought by a stranger on IRC
<kr0> Thats whhhhyyy
<benis> if you need morals taught via irc then something is wrong
<kr0> hacking today and how it will be in 10 years
<kr0> definatly

<kr0> HACKING
<kr0> wooohooo Fuck yea
<kr0> will change 
<benis> thank god internet of things
<kr0> Take a look at the InfoSec Community 
<kr0> they will PATCH ALL TEH THINGS
<kr0> They'll try to make blackhat life harder
<kr0> and they will
<kr0> BUT Stoopid people will stay 
<kr0> they'll get everything in teh webs
<kr0> your fridge 
<kr0> your table 
<benis> also your car
<anonymous> car
<kr0> your chair
<kr0> exactly
<anonymous> heart pump
<benis> and your heart transplant
<anonymous> :D
<anonymous> damn benis
<butts> your front door's locking mechanism :)
<benis> fug you keep steeling
<kr0> are you guys one ?
<kr0> exactly

<butts> the ability to turn on your stove
<benis> the ability to turn off the car's breaks
<kr0> That means
<benis> it's like diehard 4 but real
<kr0> alot more ways to fuck up
<kr0> more 0days
<anonymous> moar vulns
<kr0> everything will stay the same
<butts> >yfw people don't know you can already send packets across electrical lines

<benis> >tfw i know 50% of congress's porn habbits
<anonymous> and what abou those new smart meters:X
<kr0> except in a few years there will be a class titled " How to get rid of people , using sqlmap"

<anonymous> dont excite me like that kr0
<kr0> Social Fooling will alawys be a thing 
<benis> don't tell the CIA

<kr0> get ready
<kr0> look at Cracka , the fag who got into John Bredans Email 
<kr0> Okay it was AOL 
<kr0> BUT STILL
<benis> the director of the CIA
<benis> dude
<benis> that's not good
<anonymous> Guccifer

<kr0> The haxor of Hillary
<anonymous> the guy wasnt even technical
<anonymous> he was creative

<kr0> The biggest hacks have been executed by noobs 
<kr0> Thats why 
<anonymous> so true
<kr0> Don't rely on Kali
<benis> the biggest PUBLIC hacks have been executed by noobs
<kr0> fair enough
<anonymous> lol
<anonymous> thats the noob part making it public
<anonymous> :X
<kr0> Don't rely on 7 proxeas
<kr0> don't even rely on us
<benis> don't rely on anything but math
<kr0> USE YOUR BRAIN 
<benis> ^
<benis> brain power
<kr0> and you can basically hack everything 

-*- kr0 drops mic
<anonymous> literally, the ppl in this room are at an advantage that no one else has ever been at
<benis> except for facebook, they're hard core
<kr0> any questions ?
<anonymous> You have the entire internet to search and read on anything

*** Modus #school4lulz -m by kr0

<anonymous> Why are hackers getting busted so much?
<zero> ego maybe?
<anonymous> shut the fuck up
<anonymous> ^
<anonymous> yes ego
<benis> ^
<benis> ego is your worst enemy
<zelith> what about brute force
<anonymous> kills more hackers then anything
-*- DLF ego is not good for opsec ! Sic
<benis> if you want to hack for name and fame, do yourself a favor and get arrested
<kashloca> bad opsec

<anonymous> its tough, you do something amazing and then you cant tell anyone.  Thats hard for anyone, but in the current world of informants...you cant
<Gaylien> i used the shasum for last distro. i forgot the gpg. am i still safe?

<Gaylien> if something were wrong, fedora, debian etc. would announce it right?
<kr0> Gaylien: gpg is a way to verify IF the File you're getting is the same one they placed in there
<zelith> nsa is spying on us how?
<benis> shasum is probably fine BUT you need to get the right sum
<benis> gpg solves that

<anonymous> the nsa has never been not spying on you, its no diferent then any other corporation
<Gaylien> the shasum were correct.
<zelith> oh
<kr0> zelith: They listen to your traffic
<kr0> your phone class , etc
<benis> nsa does bulk collection and then pulls up the file on you when you commit wrongthink
<zelith> what about ssl
<kr0> learn how to encrypt them
<pretzel> in the light of bullrun, edgehill, etc, what encryptions can be trusted?
<Gaylien> using gpg to encrypt email, won't that flag me?
<benis> "ohay since you've been arrested let's take a look at your nsa file so we can throw you away for life"
<zelith> thanks
<anonymous> parallel consctuction

<kr0> Gaylien: alot of people are encrypting their mails

<benis> anonymous: you need to explain the term so people can understand
<kr0> and still
<kr0> its encrypted
<Gaylien> great!
<anonymous> ok benis

<zelith> humans will always be a flaw in security

<anonymous> is anyone familar with parallel construction?

<Gaylien> no
<anonymous> alright
<kashloca> no
<pretzel> parallel construction = coming up with dummy case to conceal the real investigation

<anonymous> the DEA was busted using it quite a bit
<anonymous> pretty much

<benis> i.e. "ur arrested for possion of marijuana"
<anonymous> using illegal means to build a legal investigation
<benis> now you're being prosicuted for treason
<anonymous> right
<Gaylien> omg
<kashloca> okay to collect evidences
<benis> isn't that ... like... illegal? :^)

<Alem> what do you guys think about PRISM and Sistems like that . . .  
<zumbaye> good info

<anonymous> "oh we pulled him over for smoking a joint and happened to go threw his phone and we found him selling secrets to china"
<anonymous> but really they were already listening to your phone
<-> shirase heißt jetzt BPS
<anonymous> so they need a legal pretext first
<Gaylien> in other words, don't smoke and drive?

<anonymous> A tactic known as “parallel construction” allows law enforcement to capitalize on intelligence information while obscuring sensitive sources and surveillance methods from the prosecution, defense and jury alike.
<fakir> hello
<anakata> In other words, don't make it easy for them to have a reason

<Gaylien> got it! cool.

<kashloca> is tor can guarantee annonymity for example for countries that don't use tor much??
<fakir> a question when we learn how to break into a pc ethics form
<fakir> ?
<fakir> a question when we learn how to break into a pc ethics form?
<benis> don't rely on tor
<benis> or anything else
<benis> tor is pretty good but it won't help if you're fucking dumb
<anakata> ^
<Gaylien> what you mean, benis? how to stay safe if not relying on anything?

<Anonymous_Rebel> If you can't rely on anything how can you know if you're safe or not?
<benis> that is the question we all ponder every day
<zelith> what do people use to get password beside phirshing and brute force
<benis> :<
<anonymous> he means it takes more then software alone to keep you safe
<anakata> Asume everything you use is compromised

<devnull> be very paranoid.
<benis> know your tool, assume everything is broken and plan accordingly
<Gaylien> i'm paranoid as hell!
<benis> tools*
<benis> not enough
<Tech-Know> zelith: dictionary, key logger, guessing

<kr0> aight guys I hope you got something out of that lesson, I'm out 
<benis> kk
<benis> -- LESSION OVER--

<butts> thanks for today's mini lesson, kr0 
<Gaylien> sure, thanx! you're awesome!!

<kr0> o/
<zelith> anything else 
<Anonymous_Rebel> Thanks!

-*- devnull bows.
<kashloca> thanks kr0 a good reminder though

<anakata>  -- LESSON FINISHED --
<kr0> np butts 
<Gaylien> great lesson!! yet another corner stone to build on!
<anakata> \o/
<DLF> ugh. already over ?
<Gaylien> THANK YOU!!

<Anonymous_Rebel> I got signed out for part of it and missed some, so when will todays script be posted?
<anakata> Thanks kr0 
<Tech-Know> zelith: passwords you've previously used on services that have been compromised
<-> dis0bey heißt jetzt Anon26643

<japa> notes ? 
<Parabole> thank 
<benis> --- END IRC LESSION --
<zelith> thanks Tech-Know 
<Gaylien> with teachers in school had this much brains!
<Tech-Know> e.g. if you use the same password for google and twitter and twitter gets hacked, they can go and look on your gmail
<anakata> benis: lol
<Gaylien> wish*
<anakata> Thank you too haha
<Tech-Know> which is why you never reuse passwords!

<benis> --- begin irc clusterfuck ---
