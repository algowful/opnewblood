<&rackham> woooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
<&rackham> nothing like walking away and coming back to a shit storm
<~kr0> basically I c/p'd #main for now :3
<&rackham> that works
<&rackham> anyway
<&rackham> sorry about the anti-forensics class...fuckin IRL always gettin in the way
<&rackham> hate real life
<&rackham> but
<&rackham> i came back to some gold and something that i think you all, as noobs, can learn a lot from
<&rackham> now
<&rackham> FUCK: please don't interrupt
<&rackham> can anybody tell me where OnionIRC went wrong?
< polski_krol> Showing persona's
< _z> \u03bb You made it a .onion \u039b
<%ad3pt> bored hackers
< MOS-6502> at its very conception
< polski_krol> mixing identities
< tcp> putting asses as ops.
< polski_krol> not being knowledgeable 
< D4rkL0rd> LOL
<&rackham> ah showing persona's
<&rackham> we'll start with that
<&rackham> how many people had an inkling that he was discordian?
< tcp> i dont care
<&rackham> well, you're here
< polski_krol> I wasnt sure he was disc.
< tcp> yes
<%ad3pt> what does it matter, really?
< polski_krol> But he did post the 3 twitters he managed.
<&rackham> it doesn't...
<&rackham> but it's about controling IDs
< polski_krol> outting himself as an operator.
< polski_krol> amongst anons.
<&rackham> okay
<&rackham> so why does it matter if OnionIRC was discoridan?
<&rackham> it doesn't.
<&rackham> don't miss the point
<&rackham> what matters is he had an id that was obliterated in the past and failed to maintain a disconnect
<&rackham> bad opsec
<&rackham> 1) there has, on more than one occassion, been times when there was a twitter conversation
<&rackham> and he would jump between Discord and OnionIRC...at least one comes to mind when I was fuckin w/ storm
<&rackham> 2) bragging up his involvement in the 3 biggest anon accounts
<+polski_krol> rackham 
<&rackham> most people are not in the know, but some are
<+polski_krol> if you wanna do this talk again later
<+polski_krol> ill help contribute, im out for now.
<&rackham> thanks for voicing and fuckin my logs for that 
<&rackham> have a nice night
<&rackham> i hope you choke on your mcdonalds
<&rackham> :)
<&rackham> dick.
<&rackham> so
<&rackham> anyway
<&rackham> not being knowledgeable...thats meh
<%ad3pt> <3
<&rackham> yeah he isn't a tech guy and was as much of a student as all of you
<&rackham> he wasn't in here teaching tech shit either so thats whatever
<&rackham> so anyway
<&rackham> this is important shit
<&rackham> because this is a classic failure of opsec
<&rackham> this isn't the first time we've been researched
<&rackham> this isn't the last
<&rackham> more dox will be posted
<&rackham> some will be fails
<&rackham> some will be correct
<&rackham> nobody is untouchable
<&rackham> that being said, where did OnionIRC FUCK up after his dox were posted?
<%ad3pt> poking the bears?
<&rackham> no, he fucking confirmed them
<&rackham> he denied and played it off for a totalof 2 minutes or so
< peter> he fucked up by putting asses as ops
< DreadPirateRoberts> don't dox me bro
<&rackham> putting asses as ops...
<&rackham> i guess i'm bias
<&rackham> because i'm one of said "assholes" or so i hear
<&rackham> but the hacking community is not for the soft skinned
<&rackham> we came from adiferent place..toughen up or find another career path
<&rackham> anyway
<&rackham> dude confirmed dox
<&rackham> there were fail dox posted here 2-3 weeks ago
<&rackham> victor, pleasego read the dodging the pipe logs...you're going to need it when you blah blah blah and go to prison
<&rackham> and i dout you want a dick in ou
<&rackham> you*
<&rackham> he could've fail doxed himself in afew days
<&rackham> and let everything et lost in the noise
<&rackham> honestly, NOBODY CARED until he sperged out
<&rackham> kr0: mona 
<&rackham> you got anything to add?
<~kr0> Not really , but its a perfect example on how NOT to react to a dox
<&rackham> why do you think thej35t3r that everybody loves so much hasn't been doxed ?
<&rackham> he's been doxed as like 30 diff people hahaha
<&mona> his real dox are amongst those 30
<~kr0> definatly
<&mona> that is a guarantee
<&rackham> but which one are they?
<&mona> same thing w/ sabu
<&mona> he was doxed ages before his identity became common knowledge
<&rackham> questions?
< localhost> so ..
< D4rkL0rd> even jeremy
< D4rkL0rd> he used chewy123 for his wifi pass
< localhost> someone confirmed their dox?
<&FUCK> he did
< D4rkL0rd> and the agencies sniffed a tor packet from his wifi
< D4rkL0rd> and
< D4rkL0rd> they confirmed the mac adddress of his pc
< D4rkL0rd> and
< D4rkL0rd> they arrested him coz
< D4rkL0rd> they had proof taht his pc connected to tor at the same time he was on an irc
<&rackham> yeah not sure where he was going with that
<&rackham> so tl;dr
<&rackham> CONTROL YOUR EMOTIONS
<&mona> ^
<&rackham> if you see your name and address pop up in here, it can be scary
<&rackham> but just take a step back and breathe
<&mona> i said it in the first ever lesson we held on this network
<&rackham> OnionIRC could've blew this off
<&rackham> and made it his word vs muerto
<&mona> drama kills hackers
<&mona> drama kills hackers
<&mona> drama kills hackers
<&mona> drama kills hackers
<&mona> drama kills hackers
<&mona> drama kills hackers
<&mona> drama kills hackers
<&mona> drama kills hackers
<&mona> evidently i didnt say it loud enough
<&rackham> but now he confirmed it to 100+ people that he is discordian
<&rackham> anything else mona ?
<&mona> hmm
<&mona> let me think
<&mona> oh yeah
<&mona> drama kills hackers
<&mona> for real
<&mona> just chill the fuck out
<&mona> if you let your emotions rule you, you will make shitty snap decisions
<&mona> you will trip over yourself and fuck up
<&mona> and you will signpost your lack of professionalism and reliability to others
<&mona> anyone with any real skill has a 6th sense for drama magnets
<&mona> tl;dr don't be a drama magnet
<&rackham> Q&A 
<&rackham> go
< thr33> pointing out the advise from dodging the pipe, control your emotion
< D4rkL0rd> just a talk on opsec at blackhat taht may help people https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1q4Ir2J8P8
< thr33> neither happy nor sad
< Kalel> is being connected to tor and irc illegal?
< rackham-zzzzzz> no
< thr33> no
< R3lcr4w> all i get from this is the less noisy you are the less probabilities you have to get doxed not a question just thinking
< localhost> no
<&rackham> R3lcr4w: right
<&rackham> if you go out there poppin off
< rackham-zzzzzz> he asked that because of what someone said earlier
<&rackham> you're gon get rekt
<&mona> yes
<&mona> it's always a tradeoff
<&mona> you're on irc because you want to talk shit
<&rackham> i was definitely prepared for my dox when i was fuckin with storm
<&mona> if you give nothing away, you are just a lurker
<&rackham> didn't happen...
<&rackham> but the probability was there
< D4rkL0rd> using tor is not illegal as long as the purpose is not illegal, if you need to do illegal stuffs you need to think about and be careful, have a good opsec
<&rackham> overall
<&rackham> its over
<&rackham> OnionIRC confirmed his own dox
<&rackham> he'll probably change ID packs and come back
< thr33> btw can you guys expand on what's happening, cause i have no context
< rackham-zzzzzz> you really confirmed it by having this class thanks :)
< localhost> me too
< D4rkL0rd> who doxed him mate?
<&mona> maybe as an op, maybe not
<&rackham> thats the beauty of this net
<&rackham> you can die today and be back tomorrow reborn
<&mona> unless you get v&<3
<&rackham> he'll learn and grow
<&rackham> just a lesson in security and self-presevation
< localhost> rackham, can you explain a bit more most cant understand
<&rackham> luckily for him, it probably won't end like his idols ended
