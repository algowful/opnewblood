<&rack-ham> alright
<&rack-ham> so
<&rack-ham> in a prior life there was a class called "laying pipe"
<&rack-ham> laying_pipe.txt
<&rack-ham> it was written by a god among men named Fox
<&rack-ham> some say I am fox
<&rack-ham> some say fox is someone else
<&rack-ham> some say fox is still out threatening ddos for job opportunities
<&rack-ham> some say he is still sleeping on jen emick's couch
<&rack-ham> this is a lulzy, lame sequel
<&rack-ham> more info on me/fox
<&rack-ham>  https://encyclopediadramatica.se/John_Field
<&rack-ham> and the being fresh/laying pipe class is in the archives
<&rack-ham> anyway
<&rack-ham> tl;dr
<&rack-ham> make sure your bathroom is right..rain like showerhead...
<&rack-ham> that way bitches know you a pimp
<&rack-ham> black credit card...
<&rack-ham> that way people know you're a smug motherfucker
<&rack-ham> and smell good
<&rack-ham> that was about laying pipe and being fresh
<&rack-ham> but this is about dodging the pipe
<&rack-ham> i think this is important
<&rack-ham> don't view the jokes and see this as not important
<&rack-ham> because you guys have been acting wreckless as FUCK in #main
<&rack-ham> and at least one of you are going to go to jail because of it
<&rack-ham> quit clicking links that randoms post
<&rack-ham> quit trying to run tor configs you have no idea what they do
<&rack-ham> i can assure you that nodes that were put on that torrc as "trusted" most definitely sniffed traffic 
<&rack-ham> so keep actin like there aren't people on this net out to get you
<&rack-ham> and you'll end up in prison
<&rack-ham> SO
<&rack-ham> i better prime you faggots up 
<&rack-ham> here are af ew steps
<&rack-ham> to make sure you don't get the pipe layed to you while you're in the slammer
<&rack-ham> NUMBER ONE
<&rack-ham> you don't have shit in prison
<&rack-ham> you have your word...you have your image...
<&rack-ham> RESPECT is key
<&rack-ham> do NOT be disrespectful
<&rack-ham> don't be in there talking shit thinking you're tough
<&rack-ham> you're not
<&rack-ham> you're a fuckin nerd.
<&rack-ham> don't be stealin shit
<&rack-ham> you're not in the streets anymore
<&rack-ham> RESPECT is all you got in the jail...
<&rack-ham> NUMBER 2
<&rack-ham> stay away from the bullshit
<&rack-ham> there is a lot of lame ass drama in jail
<&rack-ham> guards putting hits out on inmates
<&rack-ham> rumors
<&rack-ham> gossip
<&rack-ham> you'd be HSOCKED at the gradeschool mentality of some of the hardest motherfuckers in your area
<&rack-ham> stay out of the drama
<&rack-ham> stay out of the gangs
<&rack-ham> especially the gay crowd...
<&rack-ham> they WILL fuck you up...and then they'll take your booty
<&rack-ham> NUMBER 3
<&rack-ham> if you are american...you're more than likely going to get jammed up for some type of drug crime...
<&rack-ham> for wahtever reason you're there...if you're gettin high and shit, stop.
<&rack-ham> this is your chance to kick the fuckin habit
<&rack-ham> your $10 bag of heroin on the street is going to be $50 in prison.
<&rack-ham> next, you find yourself in debt with a big black killa rather than the toothless dude you've been blowin in the alley
<&rack-ham> 4)
<&rack-ham> do the time...don't let the time do you
<&rack-ham> you'll hear the phrase a lot
<&rack-ham> but you want to feel time creep...
<&rack-ham> go stand in your bathroom and stare at the wall doing NOTHING
<&rack-ham> stay busy
<&rack-ham> stay out of your head
<&rack-ham> prison really is just a big ass, long-term timeout chair
<&rack-ham> i've spent many hours staring at a brick wall because i couldn't sleep anymore and had nothing to read but the bible
<&rack-ham> and i already know how that story ends
<&rack-ham> aliens..or some shit
<&rack-ham> FIVEEEEEEEEE
<&rack-ham> DON'T TRUST ANYBODY
<&rack-ham> we preach that shit here all the time
<&rack-ham> and chances are, if you end up in prison, it's because you trusted somebody
<&rack-ham> everybody jokes about feds
<&rack-ham> ill repeat..treat everybody..>EVERYBODY like a fed
<&rack-ham> and you have nothing to worry about
<&rack-ham> dont trust anybody though...inmates, guards
<&rack-ham> nothing in prison is free
<&rack-ham> SIX...this one should be easy for the autists out there
<&rack-ham> no emotions
<&rack-ham> if you're happy, they'll destroy it
<&rack-ham> if you're angry, they'll feed fuel to it
<&rack-ham> its a hard fucking adjustment
<&rack-ham> going in there..hardening up..then coming out and your family to expect you to be normal
<&rack-ham> SEVEN
<&rack-ham> be prepared to deal with bullshit
<&rack-ham> basically
<&rack-ham> BE READY TO FIGHT
<&rack-ham> you WILL be checked at the door
<&rack-ham> you will be judged the second you walk in that door...everything you do will be analyzed
<&rack-ham> they will pick you apart and exploit you if you let them
<&rack-ham> you WILL fight
<&rack-ham> finally, and most importantly, keep your head up
<&rack-ham> it's not the end of the world and you will get out someday
<&rack-ham> i've been to prison a handful of times
<&rack-ham> i've been to the "top" in life
<&rack-ham> i've been at the bottom
<&rack-ham> and i've been back on top
<&rack-ham> keep as much contact with the outside world as possible
<&rack-ham> prison really is a toxic place and it WILL poison your mind if you let it
<&rack-ham> then the prison's welcoming committee will be a revolving door
<&rack-ham> if you have a friend that is locked up, write them.
<&rack-ham> if you don't have someone to write...write a fellow fighter
<&rack-ham> the logs are going to have information on how to write jeremy hammond
<&rack-ham> basically
<&rack-ham> this was just supposed to be a light-hearted lesson
<&rack-ham> as a joke
<&rack-ham> somethign light for a friday on a holiday weekend (for us MURICANS USA! USA!)
<&rack-ham> but it's real
<&rack-ham> and you may think i'm talking shit
<&rack-ham> because i see you in #main talking shit
<&rack-ham> but you keep actin stupid
<&rack-ham> you're going to be replaying this shit in your head
<&rack-ham> while you're sitting in a holding cell
<&rack-ham> there are no keyboards in prison
<&rack-ham> no monitors
<&rack-ham> just you, real criminals, and steel bars.
<&rack-ham> Q&A
<&rack-ham> quickly
< Lulz> fuck
< anakata> ^
< Lulz> good reality check
< The-Watcher> what a train of information.
< wow123> now that was long
< Muad_Dib> have i told you lately that i love you?
<&rack-ham> real quick
<&rack-ham> let me try and detail
<&rack-ham> what my experience was like
<&rack-ham> i wish i could get all doxxy and show you a picture of this fucking dungeon but aediot and butts will attest..
<&rack-ham> its a dungeon
<&rack-ham> so i roll up to the big ass steel door..they ring the bell, ask name and info
<&rack-ham> door starts sliding open
<&rack-ham> i go in...walls are high as fuck...
<&rack-ham> go into the basement
<&rack-ham> it smells.
<&rack-ham> it has a distinct smell
<&rack-ham> you do some paperwork
<&rack-ham> you get searched
<&rack-ham> they give you your orange jumpsuit
<&rack-ham> it fucking stinks
<&rack-ham> i went into quarantine next
<&rack-ham> so
<&rack-ham> quarantine is usually a 2 man cell w/ 4 people in it...fucked right?
<&rack-ham> this last time
<&rack-ham> i was put into a cold ass gymnasium
<&rack-ham> with 20 other people
<&rack-ham> they were getting weekly showers
<&rack-ham> quarantine...you don't get to shower for 48 hours..they give you your medical exam and all that shit make sure you don't have some crazy shit
<&rack-ham> food is cold
<&rack-ham> the lights stay on all the time..even at night
<&rack-ham> no windows
<&rack-ham> no concept of time
<&rack-ham> then you get moved to the block...
<&rack-ham> the block has like 3inx3x windows
<&rack-ham> 3 3inch x 3inch PRIVACY windows
<&rack-ham> can't see shit
<&rack-ham> you can only tell if the sun is up or down
<&rack-ham> 60 stinkin ass motherfuckers
<&rack-ham> one tv
<&rack-ham> only plays cop drama
<&rack-ham> and two and half men
<&rack-ham> it fuckin sucks
< The-Watcher> the DRAMA
<&rack-ham> ^
<&rack-ham> shit is like little girls
<&rack-ham> except if you don't play right, they'll dislocate your jaw from your head
< anakata> Why were you there?
<&rack-ham> not computer crime
<&rack-ham> kind of sort of but not really
< anakata> Business?
<&rack-ham> any other questions or can i kill these logs?
< anakata> lol
< j4ck4l> clear
< Muad_Dib> kill it
< thr33> how do you play against them trying to rattle you
< wow123> OH the lesson done
<&rack-ham> i know some of you are like "this is fuckin stupid" "i thought i was goin to learn how to ddos"
< deez> HOW DDOS?
<&rack-ham> but people are posting some shady links in #main
< deez> jk
< Muad_Dib> no this is fucking important yo
< tomcat23> fuk this waste
<&rack-ham> and posting configs to noobs that are so bad
< tomcat23> class
< thr33> i see this as a necessary evil
<&rack-ham> and i guarantee one of you will end up in prison at some point
< j3d1kn1gh7> yeah we need tobe reminded
< thr33> if you fail to prepare
< deez> hey do you mind linking the log to laying the pipes?
< The-Watcher> my advice is right. Dont trust links!
< The-Watcher> haahahah
<&rack-ham> thr33: 
<&rack-ham> you don't let them
<&rack-ham> if someone comes up and disrespects you, you gotta fight.
<&rack-ham> for real
<&rack-ham> someone wants to steal your soup, fight em
<&rack-ham> you might not win
< XCyer> if anyone thins this is waste... he's probably at the wrong place...
< The-Watcher> Be superior.
<&rack-ham> but just the fact you tried will grant you respect
< Muad_Dib> life locked up is a completely different community
< The-Watcher> show your courage!
< The-Watcher> gain respect.
<&rack-ham> alright
< deez> dont be a bich
<&rack-ham> logs off
< Muad_Dib> mind your fucking business
<&rack-ham> ^^^^^^^^^^
