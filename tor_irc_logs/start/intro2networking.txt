<@crackerjax> A network is a way for computers and devices to share resources,Â 
<@crackerjax> be it, the internet or a local private network.
<@crackerjax> Computers and devices are connected to some kind of switching device such as,Â 
<@crackerjax> a network hub to the main server or a router connecting to the internet.

<@crackerjax> network types
<@crackerjax> LAN-Local Area Network
<@crackerjax> WAN-Wide Area Network
<@crackerjax> WLAN-Wireless Local Area Network

<@crackerjax> In the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) communication model,Â 
<@crackerjax> TCP covers parts of Layer 4, the Transport Layer, and parts of Layer 5, the Session Layer.
<@crackerjax> For example, when a Web server sends an HTML file to a client, it uses the HTTP protocol to
<@crackerjax> do so
<@crackerjax> The HTTP program layer asks the TCP layer to set up the connection and send the file.
<@crackerjax> The TCP stack divides the file into packets, numbers them and then forwards them individually
StaceyÂ (Instantbir@localhost) joined the channel
<@crackerjax> to the IP layer for delivery.
<@crackerjax> Although each packet in the transmission will have the same source and destination IP addresses,
<@crackerjax> packets may be sent along multiple routes
<@crackerjax> The TCP program layer in the client computer waits until all of the packets have arrived
arc3v1lÂ (arc3v1l@localhost) joined the channel
<@crackerjax> then acknowledges those it receives and asks for the retransmission
<@crackerjax> on any it does not (based on missing packet numbers), then assembles them into a file and delivers the file to the receiving application.

<@crackerjax> To establish a connection, TCP uses a three-way handshake.

bemisÂ (Instantbir@localhost) left IRC (Quit: bemis)
<@crackerjax> The client sets the segment's sequence number to a random value A
<@crackerjax> SYN-ACK: In response, the server replies with a SYN-ACK
<@crackerjax> The acknowledgment numberÂ 
<@crackerjax> is set to one more than the received sequence number i.e. A+1
<@crackerjax> and the sequence numberÂ 
<@crackerjax> that the server chooses for the packet is another random number, B
<@crackerjax> ACK: Finally, the client sends an ACK back to the server
<@crackerjax> The sequence number is set to the received acknowledgement value i.e. A+1
<@crackerjax> and the acknowledgement number is set to one more than the received sequence number i.e. B+1
<@crackerjax> With these, a full-duplex communication is established.

<@crackerjax> more on ARPÂ 
<@crackerjax> ARP messages contain the IP address of a network resource

AnonV0125Â (chatzilla@localhost) left IRC (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
<%polski_krol> okay ill just assume whichever
<%polski_krol> So ARP is a necessary evil
<@crackerjax> maybe just what the protocol is
<%polski_krol> Address Resolution Protocol
<%polski_krol> It basically is for your local network
<%polski_krol> to know who is who
<%polski_krol> If you aren't familiar with mac addresessÂ 
<%polski_krol> now is the time to read up on them
<%polski_krol> arp is necessary to figure out your gateway
<%polski_krol> and each machine on a network will use it
<%polski_krol> The problem with ARP, although im not master of its protocol
<%polski_krol> Is that it kind of messily handles the traffic, depending on your network setup
<%polski_krol> its muted so i cant ask if everyone understands

<%polski_krol> fire sheep is that android app correct?
<%polski_krol> I think it operates a few attacks
<%polski_krol> arp is more from a regular machine
<Stacey> It was a chrome extension or something I used way back not sure if it works anymore
<%polski_krol> to send spoofed arp packets
<%polski_krol> this allows you to possibly assume the gateway, or whichever host you want to be
